NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          babeltrace2-intro - Introduction to Babeltrace 2


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is an introduction to the Babeltrace 2 project.

          The “WHAT IS BABELTRACE 2?” section describes the parts of the
          project and shows the major changes from Babeltrace 1 to
          Babeltrace 2 while the “BABELTRACE 2 CONCEPTS” section defines
          the core concepts of Babeltrace 2.

          The “TRACE PROCESSING GRAPH REPRESENTATION” section shows how
          some concepts are visually represented in other Babeltrace 2
          manual pages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Babeltrace 2 is an open-source software project of which the
          purpose is to process or convert traces (see
          <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tracing_(software)>).

          The Babeltrace 2 project includes the following parts:

          Babeltrace 2 library (libbabeltrace2)
              A shared library with a C API.

              With libbabeltrace2, you can programmatically create plugins
              and component classes, build and run trace processing graphs,
              and more (see the “BABELTRACE 2 CONCEPTS” section for more
              details about those concepts).

              All the other Babeltrace 2 parts rely on this library.

          babeltrace2 command-line program
              A command-line interface which uses libbabeltrace2 to load
              plugins, create a trace processing graph, create components,
              connect their ports correctly, and run the graph.

              You can also use babeltrace2 to list the available plugins or
              to query an object from a component class.

              See babeltrace2(1).

          Babeltrace 2 Python bindings
              A Python 3 package (bt2) which offers a Pythonic interface of
              libbabeltrace2.

              You can perform the same operations which are available in
              libbabeltrace2 with the Python bindings, but more
              conveniently and with less code. However, the Python bindings
              are less performant than libbabeltrace2.

          Babeltrace 2 project’s plugins
              The Babeltrace 2 plugins shipped with the project.

              Those plugins are not special in that they only rely on
              libbabeltrace2 and you don’t need them to use libbabeltrace2,
              babeltrace2(1), or the Python bindings. However, the
              project’s plugins provide many widely used trace format
              encoders/decoders as well as common trace processing graph
              utilities.

              The Babeltrace 2 project’s plugins are:

              ctf
                  Common Trace Format (see <https://diamon.org/ctf/>) (CTF)
                  input/output, including the LTTng live source.

                  See babeltrace2-plugin-ctf(7).

              lttng-utils
                  Graph utilities specific to LTTng (see
                  <https://lttng.org/>) traces.

                  See babeltrace2-plugin-lttng-utils(7).

              text
                  Plain text input/output.

                  See babeltrace2-plugin-text(7).

              utils
                  Common graph utilities (muxer, trimmer, counter, dummy
                  sink).

                  See babeltrace2-plugin-utils(7).

      Changes since Babeltrace 1
          This manual page is an introduction to Babeltrace 2, a rewrite of
          Babeltrace 1 with a focus on extensibility, flexibility, and
          interoperability.

          Babeltrace 1 exists since 2010.

          You can install both projects on the same file system as there
          are no file name conflicts.

          The major improvements brought by Babeltrace 2 are:

          General

              •   Full plugin support: any user can distribute a
                  Babeltrace 2 plugin and, as long as libbabeltrace2 finds
                  it, any application linked to libbabeltrace2 can load it
                  and use it.

                  Plugins are not just trace format encoders and decoders:
                  they package source, filter, and sink component classes
                  so that you can connect specialized, reusable components
                  together in a trace processing graph to create a
                  customized trace conversion or analysis device.

                  This modular strategy is much like how the FFmpeg (see
                  <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>), GStreamer (see
                  <https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/>), and DirectShow
                  (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectShow>) projects
                  approach media stream processing.

              •   All the parts of the Babeltrace 2 project run on the
                  major operating systems, including Windows and macOS.

              •   Some component classes, such as sink.text.pretty (similar
                  to the text output format of babeltrace(1)) and
                  sink.text.details, can write color codes to the standard
                  output when it’s connected to a color-enabled terminal.

                  The Babeltrace 2 log, printed to the standard output, can
                  also be colorized.

          Command-line interface

              •   Whereas you can convert traces from one format to another
                  with Babeltrace 1’s CLI tool, babeltrace(1), you can also
                  execute a custom trace manipulation task with
                  babeltrace2(1) thanks to the babeltrace2-run(1) command.

              •   The babeltrace2-convert(1) command features an automatic
                  source component discovery algorithm to find the best
                  suited components to create for a given non-option
                  argument (file or directory path, or custom string like
                  an LTTng live (see <https://lttng.org>) URL).

                  For example:

                      $ babeltrace2 /path/to/ctf/trace

                      $ babeltrace2 net://localhost/host/myhost/my-session

          CTF (see <https://diamon.org/ctf/>) input/output

              •   The source.ctf.fs component class, which is more or less
                  the equivalent of Babeltrace 1’s ctf input format, has
                  features not found in Babeltrace 1:

                  •   The component handles many trace quirks which are the
                      results of known tracer bugs and corner cases
                      (LTTng-UST, LTTng-modules, and barectf (see
                      <https://github.com/efficios/barectf>)), making it
                      possible to decode malformed packets.

                  •   The component merges CTF traces sharing the same UUID
                      into a single, logical trace.

                      This feature supports LTTng 2.11’s tracing session
                      rotation trace chunks.

              •   With a sink.ctf.fs component, you can create CTF traces
                  on the file system.

                  With babeltrace2(1), you can use the --output-format=ctf
                  and --output options to create an implicit sink.ctf.fs
                  component.

                  For example:

                      $ babeltrace2 /path/to/input/trace \
                                    --output-format=ctf --output=trace-dir

          LTTng live (see <https://lttng.org>) input

              •   The babeltrace(1) command exits successfully when it
                  cannot find an LTTng live (--input-format=lttng-live
                  option) tracing session.

                  The session-not-found-action initialization parameter
                  controls what a source.ctf.lttng-live message iterator
                  does when it cannot find the remote tracing session.

                  If the action is end, the message iterator does like
                  babeltrace(1) and simply ends successfully.

                  If the action is continue (the default), the message
                  iterator never ends: it keeps on trying until the tracing
                  session exists, indeed subscribing to the session.

          Library

              •   libbabeltrace2 shares nothing with libbabeltrace.

                  The Babeltrace 2 library C API has features such as:

                  •   A single header file.

                  •   Function precondition and postcondition checking.

                  •   Object-oriented model with shared and unique objects.

                  •   Strict C typing and const correctness.

                  •   User-extensible classes.

                  •   Rich, thread-safe error reporting.

                  •   Per-component and per-subsystem logging levels.

                  •   Trace intermediate representation (IR) objects to
                      make the API trace-format-agnostic.

                  •   A versioned protocol for message interchange between
                      components to enable forward and backward
                      compatibility.

              •   You can build the library in developer mode to enable an
                  extensive set of function precondition and postcondition
                  checks.

                  The developer mode can help detect programming errors
                  early when you develop a Babeltrace 2 plugin or an
                  application using libbabeltrace2.

                  See the project’s README for build-time requirements and
                  detailed build instructions.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This section defines the main concepts of the Babeltrace 2
          project.

          These concepts translate into types and functions in
          libbabeltrace2 and its Python bindings, but also as command-line
          actions and options in the babeltrace2 program. The other
          Babeltrace 2 manual pages assume that you are familiar with the
          following definitions.

          Some Babeltrace 2 concepts are interdependent: it is normal to
          jump from one definition to another to understand the big
          picture.

          Component class
              A reusable class which you can instantiate as one or more
              components within a trace processing graph.

              There are three types of component classes used to create the
              three types of components: source, filter, and sink.

              A component class implements methods, one of which is an
              initialization method, or constructor, to create a component.
              You pass initialization parameters to this method to
              customize the created component. For example, the
              initialization method of the source.ctf.fs component class
              accepts a mandatory inputs parameter which is an array of
              file system path(s) to the CTF trace(s). It also accepts an
              optional clock-class-offset-ns parameter which is an offset,
              in nanoseconds, to add to all the clock classes (descriptors
              of stream clocks) found in the traces’s metadata.

              A component class can have a description and a help text.

          Component
              A node within a trace processing graph.

              There are three types of components:

              Source component
                  An input component which produces messages.

                  Examples: CTF files input, log file input, LTTng live
                  input, random event generator.

              Filter component
                  An intermediate component which can transform the
                  messages it consumes, augment them, sort them, discard
                  them, or create new ones.

                  Examples: filter which removes messages based on an
                  expression, filter which adds debugging information to
                  selected events, message muxer, trace trimmer.

              Sink component
                  An output component which consumes messages and usually
                  writes them to one or more formatted files.

                  Examples: log file output, CTF files output,
                  pretty-printed plain text output.

              Components are connected together within a trace processing
              graph through their ports. Source components have output
              ports, sink components have input ports, and filter
              components have both.

              A component is the instance of a component class. The terms
              component and component class instance are equivalent.

              Within a trace processing graph, each component has a unique
              name. This is not the name of its component class, but an
              instance name. If human is a component class name, than Nancy
              and John could be component names.

              Once a graph is configured (the first time it runs), you
              cannot add components to it for the remaining graph’s
              lifetime.

          Port
              A connection point, on a component, from which are sent or
              where are received messages when the trace processing graph
              runs.

              An output port is from where messages are sent. An input port
              is where messages are received. Source components have output
              ports, sink components have input ports, and filter
              components have both.

              You can only connect an output port to a single input port.

              All ports do not need to be connected.

              A filter or sink component receiving messages from its input
              ports is said to consume messages.

              The link between an output port and input port is a
              connection.

              Once a graph is configured (the first time it runs), you
              cannot connect ports for the remaining graph’s lifetime.

          Connection
              The link between an output port and an input port through
              which messages flow when a trace processing graph runs.

          Message iterator
              An iterator on an input port of which the returned elements
              are messages.

              A component or another message iterator can create many
              message iterators on a single input port, before or while the
              trace processing graph runs.

          Message
              The element of a message iterator.

              Messages flow from output ports to input ports.

              A source component message iterator produces messages, while
              a sink component consumes them. A filter component message
              iterator can both consume and produce messages.

              The main types of messages are:

              Event
                  A trace event record within a packet or within a stream.

              Packet beginning
                  The beginning of a packet within a stream.

                  A packet is a conceptual container of events.

              Packet end
                  The end of a packet within a stream.

              Stream beginning
                  The beginning of a stream.

                  A stream is a conceptual container of packets and/or
                  events.

                  Usually, a given source component’s output port sends
                  packet and event messages which belong to a single
                  stream, but it’s not required.

              Stream end
                  The end of a stream.

              Discarded events
                  A count of discarded events within a given time interval
                  for a given stream.

              Discarded packets
                  A count of discarded packets within a given time interval
                  for a given stream.

          Trace processing graph
              A filter graph (see
              <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_graph>) where nodes are
              components and messages flow from output ports to input
              ports.

              You can build a trace processing graph with libbabeltrace2,
              with the Babeltrace 2 Python bindings, or with the
              babeltrace2-run(1) and babeltrace2-convert(1) CLI commands.

              When a trace processing graph runs, the sink components
              consume messages from their input ports, making all the
              graph’s message iterators work one message at a time to
              perform the trace conversion or analysis duty.

          Plugin
              A container, or package, of component classes as a shared
              library or Python module.

              Each component class within a plugin has a type (source,
              filter, or sink) and a name. The type and name pair is unique
              within a given plugin.

              libbabeltrace2 can load a plugin (.so, .dll, or .py file) at
              run time: the result is a plugin object in which you can find
              a specific component class and instantiate it within a trace
              processing graph as a component.

              The babeltrace2 program uses the
              COMP-CLS-TYPE.PLUGIN-NAME.COMP-CLS-NAME format to identify a
              specific component class within a specific plugin.
              COMP-CLS-TYPE is either source (or src), filter (or flt), or
              sink.

              You can list the available Babeltrace 2 plugins with the
              babeltrace2-list-plugins(1) command.

          Query
              An operation with which you can get a named object from a
              component class, possibly with custom query parameters.

              The plain text metadata stream of a CTF trace and the
              available LTTng live sessions of a given LTTng relay daemon
              are examples of query objects.

              You can use libbabeltrace2, the Babeltrace 2 Python bindings,
              or the babeltrace2-query(1) CLI command to query a component
              class’s object.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          In the Babeltrace 2 manual pages, a component is represented with
          a box. The box has the component class type, plugin name, and
          component class name at the top. Just below, between square
          brackets, is its component name within the trace processing
          graph. Each port is represented with an @ symbol on the border(s)
          of the component box with its name inside the box. Output ports
          are on the box’s right border while input ports are on the box’s
          left border.

          For example, here’s a source component box:

              +------------+
              | src.ctf.fs |
              |  [my-src]  |
              |            |
              |    stream0 @
              |    stream1 @
              |    stream2 @
              +------------+

          This one is an instance of the source.ctf.fs component class
          named my-src. It has three output ports named stream0, stream1,
          and stream2.

          A trace processing graph is represented with multiple component
          boxes connected together. The connections are arrows from output
          ports to input ports.

          For example, here’s a simple conversion graph:

              +------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
              | src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
              |    [ctf]   |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
              |            |    |                 |    |                  |
              |    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
              |    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +------------------+
              |    stream2 @--->@ in2             |
              +------------+    @ in3             |
                                +-----------------+

          Note that input port in3 of component muxer is not connected in
          this example.

          Sometimes, we symbolically represent other resources which are
          consumed from or produced by components. In this case, arrows are
          used, but they do not go to or from port symbols (@), except for
          messages. For example, in the graph above, the ctf source
          component consumes a CTF trace and the text sink component prints
          plain text to the terminal, so here’s a more complete diagram:

              CTF trace
                |
                |   +------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
                |   | src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
                '-->|    [ctf]   |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
                    |            |    |                 |    |                  |
                    |    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
                    |    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +-----+------------+
                    |    stream2 @--->@ in2             |          |
                    +------------+    @ in3             |          '--> Terminal
                                      +-----------------+

          Here’s another example of a more complex graph which splits a
          specific stream using some criteria:

              +------------+    +-----------------+    +------------------+
              | src.ctf.fs |    | flt.utils.muxer |    | sink.text.pretty |
              |  [ctf-in]  |    |     [muxer]     |    |      [text]      |
              |            |    |                 |    |                  |
              |    stream0 @--->@ in0         out @--->@ in               |
              |    stream1 @--->@ in1             |    +------------------+
              |    stream2 @-.  @ in2             |
              +------------+ |  +-----------------+      +-------------+
                             |                           | sink.ctf.fs |
                             |                           |  [ctf-out0] |
                             |  +-------------------+    |             |
                             |  | flt.some.splitter | .->@ in          |
                             |  |     [splitter]    | |  +-------------+
                             |  |                   | |
                             '->@ in              A @-'  +-------------+
                                |                 B @-.  | sink.ctf.fs |
                                +-------------------+ |  |  [ctf-out1] |
                                                      |  |             |
                                                      '->@ in          |
                                                         +-------------+
