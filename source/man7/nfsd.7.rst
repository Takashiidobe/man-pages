   nfsd(7)             Miscellaneous Information Manual             nfsd(7)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          nfsd - special filesystem for controlling Linux NFS server


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mount -t nfsd nfsd /proc/fs/nfsd


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The nfsd filesystem is a special filesystem which provides access
          to the Linux NFS server.  Writing to files in this filesystem can
          affect the server.  Reading from them can provide information
          about the server.

          As well as this filesystem, there are a collection of files in
          the procfs filesystem (normally mounted at /proc) which are used
          to control the NFS server.  This manual page describes all of
          these files.

          The exportfs and mountd programs (part of the nfs-utils package)
          expect to find this filesystem mounted at /proc/fs/nfsd or
          /proc/fs/nfs.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          Files in the nfsd filesystem include:

          exports
                 This file contains a list of filesystems that are
                 currently exported and clients that each filesystem is
                 exported to, together with a list of export options for
                 that client/filesystem pair.  This is similar to the
                 /proc/fs/nfs/exports file in 2.4.  One difference is that
                 a client doesn't necessarily correspond to just one host.
                 It can respond to a large collection of hosts that are
                 being treated identically.

                 Each line of the file contains a path name, a client name,
                 and a number of options in parentheses.  Any space, tab,
                 newline or back-slash character in the path name or client
                 name will be replaced by a backslash followed by the octal
                 ASCII code for that character.

          threads
                 This file represents the number of nfsd thread currently
                 running.  Reading it will show the number of threads.
                 Writing an ASCII decimal number will cause the number of
                 threads to be changed (increased or decreased as
                 necessary) to achieve that number.

          filehandle
                 This is a somewhat unusual file  in that what is read from
                 it depends on what was just written to it.  It provides a
                 transactional interface where a program can open the file,
                 write a request, and read a response.  If two separate
                 programs open, write, and read at the same time, their
                 requests will not be mixed up.

                 The request written to filehandle should be a client name,
                 a path name, and a number of bytes.  This should be
                 followed by a newline, with white-space separating the
                 fields, and octal quoting of special characters.

                 On writing this, the program will be able to read back a
                 filehandle for that path as exported to the given client.
                 The filehandle's length will be at most the number of
                 bytes given.

                 The filehandle will be represented in hex with a leading
                 '\x'.

          clients/
                 This directory contains a subdirectory for each NFSv4
                 client.  Each file under that subdirectory gives some
                 details about the client in YAML format.  In addition,
                 writing "expire\n" to the ctl file will force the server
                 to immediately revoke all state held by that client.

          The directory /proc/net/rpc in the procfs filesystem contains a
          number of files and directories.  The files contain statistics
          that can be display using the nfsstat program.  The directories
          contain information about various caches that the NFS server
          maintains to keep track of access permissions that different
          clients have for different filesystems.  The caches are:

          auth.unix.ip
                 This cache contains a mapping from IP address to the name
                 of the authentication domain that the ipaddress should be
                 treated as part of.

          nfsd.export
                 This cache contains a mapping from directory and domain to
                 export options.

          nfsd.fh
                 This cache contains a mapping from domain and a filesystem
                 identifier to a directory.   The filesystem identifier is
                 stored in the filehandles and consists of a number
                 indicating the type of identifier and a number of hex
                 bytes indicating the content of the identifier.

          Each directory representing a cache can hold from 1 to 3 files.
          They are:

          flush  When a number of seconds since epoch (1 Jan 1970) is
                 written to this file, all entries in the cache that were
                 last updated before that file become invalidated and will
                 be flushed out.  Writing a time in the future (in seconds
                 since epoch) will flush everything.  This is the only file
                 that will always be present.

          content
                 This file, if present, contains a textual representation
                 of ever entry in the cache, one per line.  If an entry is
                 still in the cache (because it is actively being used) but
                 has expired or is otherwise invalid, it will be presented
                 as a comment (with a leading hash character).

          channel
                 This file, if present, acts a channel for request from the
                 kernel-based nfs server to be passed to a user-space
                 program for handling.

                 When the kernel needs some information which isn't in the
                 cache, it makes a line appear in the channel file giving
                 the key for the information.  A user-space program should
                 read this, find the answer, and write a line containing
                 the key, an expiry time, and the content.  For example the
                 kernel might make
                      nfsd 127.0.0.1
                 appear in the auth.unix.ip/content file.  The user-space
                 program might then write
                      nfsd 127.0.0.1 1057206953 localhost
                 to indicate that 127.0.0.1 should map to localhost, at
                 least for now.

                 If the program uses select(2) or poll(2) to discover if it
                 can read from the channel then it will never see and end-
                 of-file but when all requests have been answered, it will
                 block until another request appears.

          In the /proc filesystem there are 4 files that can be used to
          enabled extra tracing of nfsd and related code.  They are:
               /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfs_debug
               /proc/sys/sunrpc/nfsd_debug
               /proc/sys/sunrpc/nlm_debug
               /proc/sys/sunrpc/rpc_debug
          They control tracing for the NFS client, the NFS server, the
          Network Lock Manager (lockd) and the underlying RPC layer
          respectively.  Decimal numbers can be read from or written to
          these files.  Each number represents a bit-pattern where bits
          that are set cause certain classes of tracing to be enabled.
          Consult the kernel header files to find out what number
          correspond to what tracing.

::

          This file system is only available in Linux 2.6 and later series
          kernels (and in the later parts of the 2.5 development series
          leading up to 2.6).  This man page does not apply to 2.4 and
          earlier.

          Previously the nfsctl systemcall was used for communication
          between nfsd and user utilities.  That systemcall was removed in
          kernel version 3.1.  Older nfs-utils versions were able to fall
          back to nfsctl if necessary; that was removed from nfs-utils
          1.3.5.
