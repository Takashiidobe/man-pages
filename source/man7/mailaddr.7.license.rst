      Extensively rewritten by Arnt Gulbrandsen <agulbra@troll.no>.  My
      changes are placed under the same copyright as the original BSD page.

      Adjusted by Arnt Gulbrandsen <arnt@gulbrandsen.priv.no> in 2004 to
      account for changes since 1995. Route-addrs are now even less
      common, etc. Some minor wording improvements. Same copyright.
