NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          libdrop_ambient


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This library can be used via LD_PRELOAD to force an application
          started with ambient capabilities to drop them. It leaves other
          capabilities intact. This can also be linked against and
          automatically does the right thing. You do not need to make any
          calls into the library because all the work is done in the
          constructor which runs before main() is called.
