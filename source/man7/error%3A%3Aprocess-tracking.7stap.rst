NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          warning::process-tracking - process-tracking facilities are not
          available


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These errors and warnings occur when the kernel systemtap is
          running on lacks support for user-space process tracking
          facilities.

      COMPILE-TIME ERROR
          The error

                 ERROR: user-space process-tracking facilities not available

          occurs when the script contains a uprobes probe point that the
          current kernel does not support.

      RUNTIME WARNINGS
          The warning,

                 WARNING: process-tracking facilities are not available in this kernel

          and the related message,

                 WARNING: cannot track target in process '...'

          both occur at runtime when running on a kernel (generally an
          older version) that has neither utrace functionality nor an
          acceptable substitute.

          The script should still load and run. However, probes that rely
          on availability of process-tracking facilities will silently fail
          to trigger.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If process-tracking functionality is absolutely necessary, either
          a kernel version newer than 3.5 is needed, or an older version
          must be compiled with appropriate utrace patches.
