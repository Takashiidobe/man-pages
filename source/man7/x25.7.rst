   X25(7)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 X25(7)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          x25 - ITU-T X.25 / ISO-8208 protocol interface


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <sys/socket.h>
          #include <linux/x25.h>

          x25_socket = socket(AF_X25, SOCK_SEQPACKET, 0);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          X25 sockets provide an interface to the X.25 packet layer
          protocol.  This allows applications to communicate over a public
          X.25 data network as standardized by International
          Telecommunication Union's recommendation X.25 (X.25 DTE-DCE
          mode).  X25 sockets can also be used for communication without an
          intermediate X.25 network (X.25 DTE-DTE mode) as described in
          ISO-8208.

          Message boundaries are preserved — a read(2) from a socket will
          retrieve the same chunk of data as output with the corresponding
          write(2) to the peer socket.  When necessary, the kernel takes
          care of segmenting and reassembling long messages by means of the
          X.25 M-bit.  There is no hard-coded upper limit for the message
          size.  However, reassembling of a long message might fail if
          there is a temporary lack of system resources or when other
          constraints (such as socket memory or buffer size limits) become
          effective.  If that occurs, the X.25 connection will be reset.

      Socket addresses
          The AF_X25 socket address family uses the struct sockaddr_x25 for
          representing network addresses as defined in ITU-T recommendation
          X.121.

              struct sockaddr_x25 {
                  sa_family_t sx25_family;    /* must be AF_X25 */
                  x25_address sx25_addr;      /* X.121 Address */
              };

          sx25_addr contains a char array x25_addr[] to be interpreted as a
          null-terminated string.  sx25_addr.x25_addr[] consists of up to
          15 (not counting the terminating null byte) ASCII characters
          forming the X.121 address.  Only the decimal digit characters
          from '0' to '9' are allowed.

      Socket options
          The following X.25-specific socket options can be set by using
          setsockopt(2) and read with getsockopt(2) with the level argument
          set to SOL_X25.

          X25_QBITINCL
                 Controls whether the X.25 Q-bit (Qualified Data Bit) is
                 accessible by the user.  It expects an integer argument.
                 If set to 0 (default), the Q-bit is never set for outgoing
                 packets and the Q-bit of incoming packets is ignored.  If
                 set to 1, an additional first byte is prepended to each
                 message read from or written to the socket.  For data read
                 from the socket, a 0 first byte indicates that the Q-bits
                 of the corresponding incoming data packets were not set.
                 A first byte with value 1 indicates that the Q-bit of the
                 corresponding incoming data packets was set.  If the first
                 byte of the data written to the socket is 1, the Q-bit of
                 the corresponding outgoing data packets will be set.  If
                 the first byte is 0, the Q-bit will not be set.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The AF_X25 protocol family is a new feature of Linux 2.2.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Plenty, as the X.25 PLP implementation is CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL.

          This man page is incomplete.

          There is no dedicated application programmer's header file yet;
          you need to include the kernel header file <linux/x25.h>.
          CONFIG_EXPERIMENTAL might also imply that future versions of the
          interface are not binary compatible.

          X.25 N-Reset events are not propagated to the user process yet.
          Thus, if a reset occurred, data might be lost without notice.
