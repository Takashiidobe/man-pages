NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          error::fault - memory access faults


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Read or write faults can occur during the operation of a
          systemtap script, if the script causes dereferencing of a pointer
          that turns out to be invalid.  This can be caused by using
          context variables that do not happen to have valid values, or
          perhaps references to memory that is unavailable at that moment
          due to paging.

          These fault conditions are benign because they are caught by the
          systemtap runtime, which cleanly terminates the script.  If quick
          termination is not desired, consider using the --skip-badvars or
          --suppress-handler-errors or -DMAXERRORS=NN stap options, or
          wrapping relevant parts of the probe handlers in a try/catch
          block.

          It may be possible to adjust the target program, to make it more
          likely that needed context variables are paged in when systemtap
          looks for them.  Consider adding some lightweight processing on
          the key variables, like a strlen(foo) for a string, or iterating
          across elements of an array or linked list, or touching a few
          bytes of a heap-allocated block.  The idea is to trigger any page
          faults in the target program, before systemtap would need to (but
          can't).
