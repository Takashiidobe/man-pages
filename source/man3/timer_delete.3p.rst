   TIMER_DELETE(3P)        POSIX Programmer's Manual       TIMER_DELETE(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          timer_delete — delete a per-process timer


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <time.h>

          int timer_delete(timer_t timerid);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The timer_delete() function deletes the specified timer, timerid,
          previously created by the timer_create() function. If the timer
          is armed when timer_delete() is called, the behavior shall be as
          if the timer is automatically disarmed before removal. The
          disposition of pending signals for the deleted timer is
          unspecified.

          The behavior is undefined if the value specified by the timerid
          argument to timer_delete() does not correspond to a timer ID
          returned by timer_create() but not yet deleted by timer_delete().


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If successful, the timer_delete() function shall return a value
          of zero. Otherwise, the function shall return a value of -1 and
          set errno to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          No errors are defined.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          If an implementation detects that the value specified by the
          timerid argument to timer_delete() does not correspond to a timer
          ID returned by timer_create() but not yet deleted by
          timer_delete(), it is recommended that the function should fail
          and report an [EINVAL] error.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.
