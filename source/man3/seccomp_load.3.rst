NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          seccomp_load - Load the current seccomp filter into the kernel


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <seccomp.h>

          typedef void * scmp_filter_ctx;

          int seccomp_load(scmp_filter_ctx ctx);

          Link with -lseccomp.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Loads the seccomp filter provided by ctx into the kernel; if the
          function succeeds the new seccomp filter will be active when the
          function returns.

          As it is possible to have multiple stacked seccomp filters for a
          given task (defined as either a process or a thread), it is
          important to remember that each of the filters loaded for a given
          task are executed when a syscall is made and the "strictest" rule
          is the rule that is applied.  In the case of seccomp, "strictest"
          is defined as the action with the lowest value (e.g.
          SCMP_ACT_KILL is "stricter" than SCMP_ACT_ALLOW ).


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Returns zero on success or one of the following error codes on
          failure:

          -ECANCELED
                 There was a system failure beyond the control of the
                 library.

          -EFAULT
                 Internal libseccomp failure.

          -EINVAL
                 Invalid input, either the context or architecture token is
                 invalid.

          -ENOMEM
                 The library was unable to allocate enough memory.

          -ESRCH Unable to load the filter due to thread issues.

          If the SCMP_FLTATR_API_SYSRAWRC filter attribute is non-zero then
          additional error codes may be returned to the caller; these
          additional error codes are the negative errno values returned by
          the system.  Unfortunately libseccomp can make no guarantees
          about these return values.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <seccomp.h>

          int main(int argc, char *argv[])
          {
               int rc = -1;
               scmp_filter_ctx ctx;

               ctx = seccomp_init(SCMP_ACT_KILL);
               if (ctx == NULL)
                    goto out;

               /* ... */

               rc = seccomp_load(ctx);
               if (rc < 0)
                    goto out;

               /* ... */

          out:
               seccomp_release(ctx);
               return -rc;
          }


---------------------------------------------------

::

          While the seccomp filter can be generated independent of the
          kernel, kernel support is required to load and enforce the
          seccomp filter generated by libseccomp.

          The libseccomp project site, with more information and the source
          code repository, can be found at
          https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp.  This tool, as well as the
          libseccomp library, is currently under development, please report
          any bugs at the project site or directly to the author.
