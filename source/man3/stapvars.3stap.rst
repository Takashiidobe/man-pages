   STAPVARS(3stap)                                          STAPVARS(3stap)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          stapvars - systemtap variables


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following sections enumerate the public variables provided by
          standard tapsets installed, (the installation path is show in the
          stappaths (7) manual page).  Each variable is described with a
          type, and its behavior/restrictions.  The syntax is the same as
          printed with the stap option -p2.  Examples:

          example1:long
                 Variable "example1" contains an integer.

          example2:string [long]
                 Variable "example2" is an array of strings, indexed by
                 integers.

      ARGV
          argc:long
                 Contains the value of the  $# value: the number of command
                 line arguments passed to the systemtap script.  It is
                 initialized with an implicit begin(-1) probe.

          argv:string [long]
                 Contains each command line argument as a string.  argv[1]
                 will equal @1 if there was at least one command line
                 argument.  Arguments beyond #32 are not transcribed, and
                 produce a warning message within the begin(-1) probe that
                 initializes this array.

      NULL
          NULL:long
                 Simply defined as the number 0.
