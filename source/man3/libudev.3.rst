   LIBUDEV(3)                       libudev                      LIBUDEV(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          libudev - API for enumerating and introspecting local devices


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <libudev.h>

          pkg-config --cflags --libs libudev


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          libudev.h provides APIs to introspect and enumerate devices on
          the local system.

          All functions require a libudev context to operate. This context
          can be create via udev_new(3). It is used to track library state
          and link objects together. No global state is used by libudev,
          everything is always linked to a udev context.

          All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
          specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
          lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and
          use each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not
          safe to allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or
          free it from any other, even if locking is used to ensure these
          threads don't operate on it at the very same time.

          To introspect a local device on a system, a udev device object
          can be created via udev_device_new_from_syspath(3) and friends.
          The device object allows one to query current state, read and
          write attributes and lookup properties of the device in question.

          To enumerate local devices on the system, an enumeration object
          can be created via udev_enumerate_new(3).

          To monitor the local system for hotplugged or unplugged devices,
          a monitor can be created via udev_monitor_new_from_netlink(3).

          Whenever libudev returns a list of objects, the
          udev_list_entry(3) API should be used to iterate, access and
          modify those lists.

          Furthermore, libudev also exports legacy APIs that should not be
          used by new software (and as such are not documented as part of
          this manual). This includes the hardware database known as
          udev_hwdb (please use the new sd-hwdb(3) API instead) and the
          udev_queue object to query the udev daemon (which should not be
          used by new software at all).
