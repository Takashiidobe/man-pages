   FDETACH(3P)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            FDETACH(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          fdetach — detach a name from a STREAMS-based file descriptor
          (STREAMS)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <stropts.h>

          int fdetach(const char *path);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The fdetach() function shall detach a STREAMS-based file from the
          file to which it was attached by a previous call to fattach().
          The path argument points to the pathname of the attached STREAMS
          file. The process shall have appropriate privileges or be the
          owner of the file.  A successful call to fdetach() shall cause
          all pathnames that named the attached STREAMS file to again name
          the file to which the STREAMS file was attached. All subsequent
          operations on path shall operate on the underlying file and not
          on the STREAMS file.

          All open file descriptions established while the STREAMS file was
          attached to the file referenced by path shall still refer to the
          STREAMS file after the fdetach() has taken effect.

          If there are no open file descriptors or other references to the
          STREAMS file, then a successful call to fdetach() shall be
          equivalent to performing the last close() on the attached file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, fdetach() shall return 0; otherwise,
          it shall return -1 and set errno to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The fdetach() function shall fail if:

          EACCES Search permission is denied on a component of the path
                 prefix.

          EINVAL The path argument names a file that is not currently
                 attached.

          ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
                 resolution of the path argument.

          ENAMETOOLONG
                 The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
                 {NAME_MAX}.

          ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path
                 is an empty string.

          ENOTDIR
                 A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
                 is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
                 or the path argument contains at least one non-<slash>
                 character and ends with one or more trailing <slash>
                 characters and the last pathname component names an
                 existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
                 link to a directory.

          EPERM  The effective user ID is not the owner of path and the
                 process does not have appropriate privileges.

          The fdetach() function may fail if:

          ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
                 during resolution of the path argument.

          ENAMETOOLONG
                 The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
                 resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
                 result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

      Detaching a File
          The following example detaches the STREAMS-based file /tmp/named-
          STREAM from the file to which it was attached by a previous,
          successful call to fattach().  Subsequent calls to open this file
          refer to the underlying file, not to the STREAMS file.

              #include <stropts.h>
              ...
                  char *pathname = "/tmp/named-STREAM";
                  int ret;

                  ret = fdetach(pathname);


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The fdetach() function may be removed in a future version.
