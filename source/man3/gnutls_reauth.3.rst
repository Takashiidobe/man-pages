NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          gnutls_reauth - API function


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <gnutls/gnutls.h>

          int gnutls_reauth(gnutls_session_t session, unsigned int flags);


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          gnutls_session_t session
                      is a gnutls_session_t type.

          unsigned int flags
                      must be zero


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This function performs the post-handshake authentication for TLS
          1.3. The post-handshake authentication is initiated by the server
          by calling this function. Clients respond when
          GNUTLS_E_REAUTH_REQUEST has been seen while receiving data.

          The non-fatal errors expected by this function are:
          GNUTLS_E_INTERRUPTED, GNUTLS_E_AGAIN, as well as
          GNUTLS_E_GOT_APPLICATION_DATA when called on server side.

          The former two interrupt the authentication procedure due to the
          transport layer being interrupted, and the latter because there
          were pending data prior to peer initiating the re-authentication.
          The server should read/process that data as unauthenticated and
          retry calling gnutls_reauth().

          When this function is called under TLS1.2 or earlier or the peer
          didn't advertise post-handshake auth, it always fails with
          GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST. The verification of the received peers
          certificate is delegated to the session or credentials
          verification callbacks. A server can check whether post handshake
          authentication is supported by the client by checking the session
          flags with gnutls_session_get_flags().

          Prior to calling this function in server side, the function
          gnutls_certificate_server_set_request() must be called setting
          expectations for the received certificate (request or require).
          If none are set this function will return with
          GNUTLS_E_INVALID_REQUEST.

          Note that post handshake authentication is available irrespective
          of the initial negotiation type (PSK or certificate). In all
          cases however, certificate credentials must be set to the session
          prior to calling this function.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          GNUTLS_E_SUCCESS on a successful authentication, otherwise a
          negative error code.
