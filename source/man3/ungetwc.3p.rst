   UNGETWC(3P)             POSIX Programmer's Manual            UNGETWC(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ungetwc — push wide-character code back into the input stream


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <stdio.h>
          #include <wchar.h>

          wint_t ungetwc(wint_t wc, FILE *stream);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          The ungetwc() function shall push the character corresponding to
          the wide-character code specified by wc back onto the input
          stream pointed to by stream.  The pushed-back characters shall be
          returned by subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order
          of their pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream
          pointed to by stream) to a file-positioning function (fseek(),
          fseeko(), fsetpos(), or rewind()) or fflush() shall discard any
          pushed-back characters for the stream. The external storage
          corresponding to the stream is unchanged.

          At least one character of push-back shall be provided. If
          ungetwc() is called too many times on the same stream without an
          intervening read or file-positioning operation on that stream,
          the operation may fail.

          If the value of wc equals that of the macro WEOF, the operation
          shall fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.

          A successful call to ungetwc() shall clear the end-of-file
          indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position
          indicator for the stream after all pushed-back characters have
          been read, or discarded by calling fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(),
          or rewind() (but not fflush()), shall be the same as it was
          before the characters were pushed back. The file-position
          indicator is decremented (by one or more) by each successful call
          to ungetwc(); if its value was 0 before a call, its value is
          unspecified after the call.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, ungetwc() shall return the wide-
          character code corresponding to the pushed-back character.
          Otherwise, it shall return WEOF.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The ungetwc() function may fail if:

          EILSEQ An invalid character sequence is detected, or a wide-
                 character code does not correspond to a valid character.
