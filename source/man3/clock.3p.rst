   CLOCK(3P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              CLOCK(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          clock — report CPU time used


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <time.h>

          clock_t clock(void);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          The clock() function shall return the implementation's best
          approximation to the processor time used by the process since the
          beginning of an implementation-defined era related only to the
          process invocation.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          To determine the time in seconds, the value returned by clock()
          should be divided by the value of the macro CLOCKS_PER_SEC.
          CLOCKS_PER_SEC is defined to be one million in <time.h>.  If the
          processor time used is not available or its value cannot be
          represented, the function shall return the value (clock_t)-1.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          No errors are defined.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          In programming environments where clock_t is a 32-bit integer
          type and CLOCKS_PER_SEC is one million, clock() will start
          failing in less than 36 minutes of processor time for signed
          clock_t, or 72 minutes for unsigned clock_t.  Applications
          intended to be portable to such environments should use times()
          instead (or clock_gettime() with CLOCK_PROCESS_CPUTIME_ID, if
          supported).

          In order to measure the time spent in a program, clock() should
          be called at the start of the program and its return value
          subtracted from the value returned by subsequent calls. The value
          returned by clock() is defined for compatibility across systems
          that have clocks with different resolutions. The resolution on
          any particular system need not be to microsecond accuracy.
