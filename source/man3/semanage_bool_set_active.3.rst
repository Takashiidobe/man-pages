NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          semanage_bool_set_active - update an existing SELinux boolean in
          the currently active policy


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <semanage/booleans_active.h>

          extern int semanage_bool_set_active (
               semanage_handle_t *handle,
               const semanage_bool_key_t *key,
               const semanage_bool_t *data);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Behavior:
                 The set function will fail if no matching key is found in
                 the local store. Otherwise, the provided object will
                 replace the current one. When semanage_commit(3) is
                 invoked, changes will be written permanently into the
                 local store, and will be loaded into policy. Validity of
                 the object being added is checked at commit time.

          Parameters:
                 The handle is used to track persistent state across
                 semanage calls, and for error reporting. The key
                 identifies the data object, which will be written into the
                 store. The key are data are properties of the caller, and
                 are not stored or modified internally.

          Requirements:
                 This function requires an semanage connection to be
                 established (see semanage_connect(3) ), and must be
                 executed in a transaction (see
                 semanage_begin_transaction(3) ).


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          In case of failure, -1 is returned, and the semanage error
          callback is invoked, describing the error.  Otherwise 0 is
          returned.
