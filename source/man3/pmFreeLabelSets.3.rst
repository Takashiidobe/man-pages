NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmFreeLabelSets - release storage allocated for performance
          metric labels


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <pcp/pmapi.h>

          void pmFreeLabelSets(pmLabelSet *sets, int nsets);

          cc ... -lpcp


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The array of label sets returned by pmLookupLabels(3) and related
          APIs are allocated below the Performance Metrics Application
          Programming Interface (PMAPI) using a variety of calls to the
          system's dynamic memory allocation (i.e. malloc(3)) interfaces.

          Applications should call pmFreeLabelSets to release the storage
          previously allocated for the label sets array when access to the
          structure is no longer needed.  The return value from
          pmLookupLabels indicates the number of elements in the label sets
          array, and this should be passed in using the nsets parameter.

          Under no circumstances should an application use free(labelset)
          to release storage previously allocated for a pmLabelSet by
          pmLookupLabels(3) or related APIs.

          To simplify error handling, if sets is NULL then pmFreeLabelSets
          simply returns without freeing any storage.
