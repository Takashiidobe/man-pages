NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_message_sensitive - Mark a message object as containing
          sensitive data


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

          int sd_bus_message_sensitive(sd_bus_message *message);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_message_sensitive() marks an allocated bus message as
          containing sensitive data. This ensures that the message data is
          carefully removed from memory (specifically, overwritten with
          zero bytes) when released. It is recommended to mark all incoming
          and outgoing messages like this that contain security credentials
          and similar data that should be dealt with carefully. Note that
          it is not possible to unmark messages like this, it's a one way
          operation. If a message is already marked sensitive and then
          marked sensitive a second time the message remains marked so and
          no further operation is executed.

          As a safety precaution all messages that are created as reply to
          messages that are marked sensitive are also implicitly marked so.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On success, this functions return 0 or a positive integer. On
          failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

      Errors
          Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

          -EINVAL
              The message parameter is NULL.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be
          compiled and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
