   ACL_COPY_EXT(3)       BSD Library Functions Manual       ACL_COPY_EXT(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

        acl_copy_ext — copy an ACL from internal to external representation


-------------------------------------------------------

::

        Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <sys/acl.h>

        ssize_t
        acl_copy_ext(void *buf_p, acl_t acl, ssize_t size);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

        The acl_copy_ext() function copies the ACL pointed to by acl from
        system-managed space to the user managed space pointed to by buf_p.
        The size parameter represents the size in bytes of the buffer
        pointed to by buf_p.  The format of the ACL placed in the buffer
        pointed to by buf_p is a contiguous, persistent data item, the
        format of which is unspecified.  It is the responsibility of the
        invoker to allocate an area large enough to hold the copied ACL.
        The size of the exportable, contiguous, persistent form of the ACL
        may be obtained by invoking the acl_size() function.

        Any ACL entry descriptors that refer to an entry in the ACL
        referenced by acl continue to refer to those entries. Any existing
        ACL pointers that refer to the ACL referenced by acl continue to
        refer to the ACL.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

        Upon success, this function returns the number of bytes placed in
        the buffer pointed to by buf_p.  On error, a value of (ssize_t)-1
        is returned and errno is set appropriately.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

        If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_copy_ext()
        function returns a value of (ssize_t)-1 and sets errno to the
        corresponding value:

        [EINVAL]           The size parameter is zero or negative.

                           The argument acl is not a valid pointer to an
                           ACL.

                           The ACL referenced by acl contains one or more
                           improperly formed ACL entries, or for some other
                           reason cannot be translated into the external
                           form of an ACL.

        [ERANGE]           The size parameter is greater than zero but
                           smaller than the length of the contiguous,
                           persistent form of the ACL.
