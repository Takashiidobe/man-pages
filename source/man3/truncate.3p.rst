   TRUNCATE(3P)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           TRUNCATE(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          truncate — truncate a file to a specified length


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <unistd.h>

          int truncate(const char *path, off_t length);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The truncate() function shall cause the regular file named by
          path to have a size which shall be equal to length bytes.

          If the file previously was larger than length, the extra data is
          discarded. If the file was previously shorter than length, its
          size is increased, and the extended area appears as if it were
          zero-filled.

          The application shall ensure that the process has write
          permission for the file.

          If the request would cause the file size to exceed the soft file
          size limit for the process, the request shall fail and the
          implementation shall generate the SIGXFSZ signal for the process.

          The truncate() function shall not modify the file offset for any
          open file descriptions associated with the file. Upon successful
          completion, truncate() shall mark for update the last data
          modification and last file status change timestamps of the file,
          and the S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits of the file mode may be cleared.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, truncate() shall return 0. Otherwise,
          -1 shall be returned, and errno set to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The truncate() function shall fail if:

          EINTR  A signal was caught during execution.

          EINVAL The length argument was less than 0.

          EFBIG or EINVAL
                 The length argument was greater than the maximum file
                 size.

          EIO    An I/O error occurred while reading from or writing to a
                 file system.

          EACCES A component of the path prefix denies search permission,
                 or write permission is denied on the file.

          EISDIR The named file is a directory.

          ELOOP  A loop exists in symbolic links encountered during
                 resolution of the path argument.

          ENAMETOOLONG
                 The length of a component of a pathname is longer than
                 {NAME_MAX}.

          ENOENT A component of path does not name an existing file or path
                 is an empty string.

          ENOTDIR
                 A component of the path prefix names an existing file that
                 is neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory,
                 or the path argument contains at least one non-<slash>
                 character and ends with one or more trailing <slash>
                 characters and the last pathname component names an
                 existing file that is neither a directory nor a symbolic
                 link to a directory.

          EROFS  The named file resides on a read-only file system.

          The truncate() function may fail if:

          ELOOP  More than {SYMLOOP_MAX} symbolic links were encountered
                 during resolution of the path argument.

          ENAMETOOLONG
                 The length of a pathname exceeds {PATH_MAX}, or pathname
                 resolution of a symbolic link produced an intermediate
                 result with a length that exceeds {PATH_MAX}.
