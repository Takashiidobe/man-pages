   LIBPFM(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              LIBPFM(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

           libpfm_intel_p6 - support for Intel P5 based processors


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>

          PMU name: pm, ppro, pii, piii, p6
          PMU desc: Intel Pentium M, Intel Pentium Pro, Intel Pentium II, Intel Pentium III, Intel P6


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The library supports all Intel P6-based processors all the way
          back to the Pentium Pro. Although all those processors offers the
          same PMU architecture, they differ in the events they provide.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following modifiers are supported on all Intel P6 processors:

          u      Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
                 2, 3. This corresponds to PFM_PLM3.  This is a boolean
                 modifier.

          k      Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
                 This corresponds to PFM_PLM0.  This is a boolean modifier.

          i      Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
                 count cycles in which the event is not occurring. This is
                 a boolean modifier

          e      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
                 state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

          c      Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
                 The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
                 number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
                 the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
                 the range [0:255].
