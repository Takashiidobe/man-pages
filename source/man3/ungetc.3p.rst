   UNGETC(3P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             UNGETC(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ungetc — push byte back into input stream


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <stdio.h>

          int ungetc(int c, FILE *stream);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          The ungetc() function shall push the byte specified by c
          (converted to an unsigned char) back onto the input stream
          pointed to by stream.  The pushed-back bytes shall be returned by
          subsequent reads on that stream in the reverse order of their
          pushing. A successful intervening call (with the stream pointed
          to by stream) to a file-positioning function (fseek(), fseeko(),
          fsetpos(), or rewind()) or fflush() shall discard any pushed-back
          bytes for the stream. The external storage corresponding to the
          stream shall be unchanged.

          One byte of push-back shall be provided. If ungetc() is called
          too many times on the same stream without an intervening read or
          file-positioning operation on that stream, the operation may
          fail.

          If the value of c equals that of the macro EOF, the operation
          shall fail and the input stream shall be left unchanged.

          A successful call to ungetc() shall clear the end-of-file
          indicator for the stream. The value of the file-position
          indicator for the stream after all pushed-back bytes have been
          read, or discarded by calling fseek(), fseeko(), fsetpos(), or
          rewind() (but not fflush()), shall be the same as it was before
          the bytes were pushed back. The file-position indicator is
          decremented by each successful call to ungetc(); if its value was
          0 before a call, its value is unspecified after the call.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, ungetc() shall return the byte pushed
          back after conversion. Otherwise, it shall return EOF.
