   SD_BUS_SET_FD(3)              sd_bus_set_fd             SD_BUS_SET_FD(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_set_fd - Set the file descriptors to use for bus
          communication


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

          int sd_bus_set_fd(sd_bus *bus, int input_fd, int output_fd);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_set_fd() sets the file descriptors used to communicate by
          a bus connection object. Both input_fd and output_fd must be
          valid file descriptors, referring to stream-based file objects
          (e.g. a stream socket, a pair of pipes or FIFOs, or even a TTY
          device).  input_fd must be readable, and output_fd must be
          writable. The same file descriptor may be used (and typically is
          used) as both the input and the output file descriptor. This
          function must be called before the bus connection is started via
          sd_bus_start(3).

          The bus connection object will take possession of the passed file
          descriptors and will close them automatically when it is freed.
          Use sd_bus_set_close_on_exit(3) to turn off this behaviour.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On success, sd_bus_set_fd() returns a non-negative integer. On
          failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

      Errors
          Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

          -EINVAL
              An invalid bus object was passed.

          -ECHILD
              The bus connection was allocated in a parent process and is
              being reused in a child process after fork().

          -EBADF
              An invalid file descriptor was passed to sd_bus_set_fd().

          -ENOPKG
              The bus cannot be resolved.

          -EPERM
              The bus connection has already been started.

          These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be
          compiled and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
