NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          wresize - resize a curses window


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <curses.h>

          int wresize(WINDOW *win, int lines, int columns);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This is an extension to the curses library.  It reallocates
          storage for an ncurses window to adjust its dimensions to the
          specified values.  If either dimension is larger than the current
          values, the window's data is filled with blanks that have the
          current background rendition (as set by wbkgdset) merged into
          them.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The function returns the integer ERR upon failure and OK on
          success.  It will fail if either of the dimensions less than or
          equal to zero, or if an error occurs while (re)allocating memory
          for the window.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The only restriction placed on the dimensions is that they be
          greater than zero.  The dimensions are not compared to curses
          screen dimensions to simplify the logic of resizeterm.  The
          caller must ensure that the window's dimensions fit within the
          actual screen dimensions.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          It is not possible to resize windows with SVr4 curses.

          This extension of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.  It was
          adopted in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).
