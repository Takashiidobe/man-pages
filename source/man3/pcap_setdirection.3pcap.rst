   PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)                        PCAP_SETDIRECTION(3PCAP)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pcap_setdirection - set the direction for which packets will be
          captured


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <pcap/pcap.h>

          int pcap_setdirection(pcap_t *p, pcap_direction_t d);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcap_setdirection() is used to specify a direction that packets
          will be captured.  d is one of the constants PCAP_D_IN,
          PCAP_D_OUT or PCAP_D_INOUT.  PCAP_D_IN will only capture packets
          received by the device, PCAP_D_OUT will only capture packets sent
          by the device and PCAP_D_INOUT will capture packets received by
          or sent by the device.  PCAP_D_INOUT is the default setting if
          this function is not called.

          pcap_setdirection() isn't necessarily fully supported on all
          platforms; some platforms might return an error for all values,
          and some other platforms might not support PCAP_D_OUT.

          This operation is not supported if a ``savefile'' is being read.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcap_setdirection() returns 0 on success and PCAP_ERROR on
          failure. If PCAP_ERROR is returned, pcap_geterr(3PCAP) or
          pcap_perror(3PCAP) may be called with p as an argument to fetch
          or display the error text.
