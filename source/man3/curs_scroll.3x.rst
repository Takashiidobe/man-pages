   curs_scroll(3X)                                          curs_scroll(3X)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          scroll, scrl, wscrl - scroll a curses window


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <curses.h>

          int scroll(WINDOW *win);

          int scrl(int n);
          int wscrl(WINDOW *win, int n);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The scroll routine scrolls the window up one line.  This involves
          moving the lines in the window data structure.  As an
          optimization, if the scrolling region of the window is the entire
          screen, the physical screen may be scrolled at the same time.

          For positive n, the scrl and wscrl routines scroll the window up
          n lines (line i+n becomes i); otherwise scroll the window down n
          lines.  This involves moving the lines in the window character
          image structure.  The current cursor position is not changed.

          For these functions to work, scrolling must be enabled via
          scrollok.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These routines return ERR upon failure, and OK (SVr4 only
          specifies "an integer value other than ERR") upon successful
          completion.

          X/Open defines no error conditions.

          This implementation returns an error if the window pointer is
          null, or if scrolling is not enabled in the window, e.g., with
          scrollok.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Note that scrl and scroll may be macros.

          The SVr4 documentation says that the optimization of physically
          scrolling immediately if the scroll region is the entire screen
          “is” performed, not “may be” performed.  This implementation
          deliberately does not guarantee that this will occur, to leave
          open the possibility of smarter optimization of multiple scroll
          actions on the next update.

          Neither the SVr4 nor the XSI documentation specify whether the
          current attribute or current color-pair of blanks generated by
          the scroll function is zeroed.  Under this implementation it is.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.
