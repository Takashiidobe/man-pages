   PMGETARCHIVEEND(3)      Library Functions Manual      PMGETARCHIVEEND(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmGetArchiveEnd - locate logical end of file for a set of archive
          logs


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <pcp/pmapi.h>

          int pmGetArchiveEnd(struct timeval *tvp);

          cc ... -lpcp


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Assuming the current PMAPI context is associated with a set of
          archive logs, pmGetArchiveEnd will attempt to find the logical
          end of file (after the last complete record in the set of
          archives), and return the last recorded timestamp via tvp.  This
          timestamp may be passed to pmSetMode(3) to reliably position the
          context at the last valid log record, e.g. in preparation for
          subsequent reading in reverse chronological order.

          For archive logs that are not concurrently being written, the
          physical end of file and the logical end of file are co-incident.
          However if an archive log is being written by pmlogger(1) at the
          same time an application is trying to read the archive, the
          logical end of file may be before the physical end of file due to
          write buffering that is not aligned with the logical record
          boundaries.

          pmGetArchiveEnd returns an error less than zero if the context is
          neither valid, nor associated with a set of archives, or the set
          of archives is seriously corrupted.  Otherwise, the return value
          is 0 if there has been no change of state since the last call, or
          1 if the logical end of file has advanced since the last call.

          In the absence of an error, the result returned via tvp is well-
          defined.

          pmGetArchiveEnd preserves the positioning state of the log file
          prior to this function call.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          PM_ERR_NOCONTEXT
                 the current PMAPI context is either invalid, or not
                 associated with an set of archive logs

          PM_ERR_LOGREC
                 the set of archives is sufficiently damaged, that not a
                 single valid record can be found


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).  Values for these variables may be obtained
          programmatically using the pmGetConfig(3) function.

          pmGetConfig(3), pmSetMode(3), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
