   FWRITE(3P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             FWRITE(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          fwrite — binary output


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <stdio.h>

          size_t fwrite(const void *restrict ptr, size_t size, size_t nitems,
              FILE *restrict stream);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          The fwrite() function shall write, from the array pointed to by
          ptr, up to nitems elements whose size is specified by size, to
          the stream pointed to by stream.  For each object, size calls
          shall be made to the fputc() function, taking the values (in
          order) from an array of unsigned char exactly overlaying the
          object. The file-position indicator for the stream (if defined)
          shall be advanced by the number of bytes successfully written. If
          an error occurs, the resulting value of the file-position
          indicator for the stream is unspecified.

          The last data modification and last file status change timestamps
          of the file shall be marked for update between the successful
          execution of fwrite() and the next successful completion of a
          call to fflush() or fclose() on the same stream, or a call to
          exit() or abort().


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The fwrite() function shall return the number of elements
          successfully written, which may be less than nitems if a write
          error is encountered. If size or nitems is 0, fwrite() shall
          return 0 and the state of the stream remains unchanged.
          Otherwise, if a write error occurs, the error indicator for the
          stream shall be set, and errno shall be set to indicate the
          error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Refer to fputc(3p).

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Because of possible differences in element length and byte
          ordering, files written using fwrite() are application-dependent,
          and possibly cannot be read using fread() by a different
          application or by the same application on a different processor.


-----------------------------------------------------------

          None.
