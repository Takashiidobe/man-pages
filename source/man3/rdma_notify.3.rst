   RDMA_NOTIFY(3)        Librdmacm Programmer's Manual       RDMA_NOTIFY(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          rdma_notify - Notifies the librdmacm of an asynchronous event.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <rdma/rdma_cma.h>

          int rdma_notify (struct rdma_cm_id *id, enum ibv_event_type
          event);


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          id          RDMA identifier.

          event       Asynchronous event.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Used to notify the librdmacm of asynchronous events that have
          occurred on a QP associated with the rdma_cm_id.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Returns 0 on success, or -1 on error.  If an error occurs, errno
          will be set to indicate the failure reason.  If errno is set to
          EISCONN (transport endpoint is already connected), this indicates
          that the the underlying communication manager established the
          connection before the call to rdma_notify could be processed.  In
          this case, the error may safely be ignored.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Asynchronous events that occur on a QP are reported through the
          user's device event handler.  This routine is used to notify the
          librdmacm of communication events.  In most cases, use of this
          routine is not necessary, however if connection establishment is
          done out of band (such as done through Infiniband), it's possible
          to receive data on a QP that is not yet considered connected.
          This routine forces the connection into an established state in
          this case in order to handle the rare situation where the
          connection never forms on its own.  Calling this routine ensures
          the delivery of the RDMA_CM_EVENT_ESTABLISHED event to the
          application.  Events that should be reported to the CM are:
          IB_EVENT_COMM_EST.
