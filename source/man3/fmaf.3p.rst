   FMA(3P)                 POSIX Programmer's Manual                FMA(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          fma, fmaf, fmal — floating-point multiply-add


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <math.h>

          double fma(double x, double y, double z);
          float fmaf(float x, float y, float z);
          long double fmal(long double x, long double y, long double z);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          These functions shall compute (x * y) + z, rounded as one ternary
          operation: they shall compute the value (as if) to infinite
          precision and round once to the result format, according to the
          rounding mode characterized by the value of FLT_ROUNDS.

          An application wishing to check for error situations should set
          errno to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before
          calling these functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or
          fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW |
          FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, these functions shall return
          (x * y) + z, rounded as one ternary operation.

          If the result overflows or underflows, a range error may occur.
          On systems that support the IEC 60559 Floating-Point option, if
          the result overflows a range error shall occur.

          If x or y are NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

          If x multiplied by y is an exact infinity and z is also an
          infinity but with the opposite sign, a domain error shall occur,
          and either a NaN (if supported), or an implementation-defined
          value shall be returned.

          If one of x and y is infinite, the other is zero, and z is not a
          NaN, a domain error shall occur, and either a NaN (if supported),
          or an implementation-defined value shall be returned.

          If one of x and y is infinite, the other is zero, and z is a NaN,
          a NaN shall be returned and a domain error may occur.

          If x*y is not 0*Inf nor Inf*0 and z is a NaN, a NaN shall be
          returned.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          These functions shall fail if:

          Domain Error
                      The value of x*y+z is invalid, or the value x*y is
                      invalid and z is not a NaN.

                      If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
                      MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
                      [EDOM].  If the integer expression (math_errhandling
                      & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid
                      floating-point exception shall be raised.

          Range Error The result overflows.

                      If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
                      MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
                      [ERANGE].  If the integer expression
                      (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then
                      the overflow floating-point exception shall be
                      raised.

          These functions may fail if:

          Domain Error
                      The value x*y is invalid and z is a NaN.

                      If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
                      MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
                      [EDOM].  If the integer expression (math_errhandling
                      & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then the invalid
                      floating-point exception shall be raised.

          Range Error The result underflows.

                      If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
                      MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
                      [ERANGE].  If the integer expression
                      (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then
                      the underflow floating-point exception shall be
                      raised.

          Range Error The result overflows.

                      If the integer expression (math_errhandling &
                      MATH_ERRNO) is non-zero, then errno shall be set to
                      [ERANGE].  If the integer expression
                      (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) is non-zero, then
                      the overflow floating-point exception shall be
                      raised.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On error, the expressions (math_errhandling & MATH_ERRNO) and
          (math_errhandling & MATH_ERREXCEPT) are independent of each
          other, but at least one of them must be non-zero.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          In many cases, clever use of floating (fused) multiply-add leads
          to much improved code; but its unexpected use by the compiler can
          undermine carefully written code. The FP_CONTRACT macro can be
          used to disallow use of floating multiply-add; and the fma()
          function guarantees its use where desired. Many current machines
          provide hardware floating multiply-add instructions; software
          implementation can be used for others.
