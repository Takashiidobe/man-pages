   LIBPFM(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              LIBPFM(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          libpfm_intel_rapl - support for Intel RAPL PMU


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>

          PMU name: rapl
          PMU desc: Intel RAPL (Intel SandyBridge, IvyBridge, Haswell)


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The library supports the Intel Running Average Power Limit (RAPL)
          energy consumption counters. This is a socket-level set of
          counters which reports energy consumption in Joules. There are up
          to 3 counters each measuring only one event. The following events
          are defined:

          RAPL_ENERGY_CORES
                 On all processors, the event reports the number of Joules
                 consumed by all cores.
                  On all processors,

          RAPL_ENERGYC_PKG
                 On all processors, th event reports the number of Joules
                 consumed by all the cores and Last Level cache (L3).

          RAPL_ENERGY_DRAM
                 On server processors, the event reports the number of
                 Joules consumed n by the DRAM controller.

                 By construction, the events are socket-level and can only
                 be measured in system-wide mode. It is necessary and
                 sufficient to measure only one CPU per socket to get
                 meaningful results.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The PMU does not support any modifiers.
