   PCAP_FILE(3PCAP)                                        PCAP_FILE(3PCAP)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pcap_file - get the standard I/O stream for a savefile being read


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <pcap/pcap.h>

          FILE *pcap_file(pcap_t *p);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcap_file() returns the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile,''
          if a ``savefile'' was opened with pcap_open_offline(3PCAP), or
          NULL, if a network device was opened with pcap_create(3PCAP) and
          pcap_activate(3PCAP), or with pcap_open_live(3PCAP).

          Note that the Packet Capture library is usually built with large
          file support, so the standard I/O stream of the ``savefile''
          might refer to a file larger than 2 gigabytes; applications that
          use pcap_file() should, if possible, use calls that support large
          files on the return value of pcap_file() or the value returned by
          fileno(3) when passed the return value of pcap_file().
