NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          mcprint - ship binary data to printer


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <curses.h>

          int mcprint(char *data, int len);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This function uses the mc5p or mc4 and mc5 capabilities, if they
          are present, to ship given data to a printer attached to the
          terminal.

          Note that the mcprint code has no way to do flow control with the
          printer or to know how much buffering it has.  Your application
          is responsible for keeping the rate of writes to the printer
          below its continuous throughput rate (typically about half of its
          nominal cps rating).  Dot-matrix printers and 6-page-per-minute
          lasers can typically handle 80cps, so a good conservative rule of
          thumb is to sleep for a second after shipping each 80-character
          line.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The mcprint function returns ERR if the write operation aborted
          for some reason.  In this case, errno will contain either an
          error associated with write(2) or one of the following:

          ENODEV
               Capabilities for printer redirection do not exist.

          ENOMEM
               Couldn't allocate sufficient memory to buffer the printer
               write.

          When mcprint succeeds, it returns the number of characters
          actually sent to the printer.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The mcprint call was designed for ncurses(3X), and is not found
          in SVr4 curses, 4.4BSD curses, or any other previous version of
          curses.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Padding in the mc5p, mc4 and mc5 capabilities will not be
          interpreted.
