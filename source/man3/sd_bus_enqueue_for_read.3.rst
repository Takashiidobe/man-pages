NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_enqueue_for_read - Re-enqueue a bus message on a bus
          connection, for reading


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <systemd/sd-bus.h>

          int sd_bus_enqueue_for_read(sd_bus *bus,
                                      sd_bus_message *message);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_bus_enqueue_for_read() may be used to re-enqueue an incoming
          bus message on the local read queue, so that it is processed and
          dispatched locally again, similar to how an incoming message from
          the peer is processed. Takes a bus connection object and the
          message to enqueue. A reference is taken of the message and the
          caller's reference thus remains in possession of the caller. The
          message is enqueued at the end of the queue, thus will be
          dispatched after all other already queued messages are
          dispatched.

          This call is primarily useful for dealing with incoming method
          calls that may be processed only after an additional asynchronous
          operation completes. One example are PolicyKit authorization
          requests that are determined to be necessary to authorize a newly
          incoming method call: when the PolicyKit response is received the
          original method call may be re-enqueued to process it again, this
          time with the authorization result known.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On success, this function return 0 or a positive integer. On
          failure, it returns a negative errno-style error code.

      Errors
          Returned errors may indicate the following problems:

          -ECHILD
              The bus connection has been created in a different process.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be
          compiled and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
