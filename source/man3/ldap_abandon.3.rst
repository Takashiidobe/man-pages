   LDAP_ABANDON(3)         Library Functions Manual         LDAP_ABANDON(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ldap_abandon_ext - Abandon an LDAP operation in progress


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          OpenLDAP LDAP (libldap, -lldap)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <ldap.h>

          int ldap_abandon_ext(
                 LDAP *ld,
                 Bint msgid,
                 LDAPControl **sctrls,
                 LDAPControl **cctrls );


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The ldap_abandon_ext() routine is used to send a LDAP Abandon
          request for an operation in progress.  The msgid passed should be
          the message id of an outstanding LDAP operation, such as returned
          by ldap_search_ext(3).

          ldap_abandon_ext() checks to see if the result of the operation
          has already come in.  If it has, it deletes it from the queue of
          pending messages.  If not, it sends an LDAP abandon request to
          the LDAP server.

          The caller can expect that the result of an abandoned operation
          will not be returned from a future call to ldap_result(3).

          ldap_abandon_ext() allows server and client controls to be passed
          in via the sctrls and cctrls parameters, respectively.

          ldap_abandon_ext() returns a code indicating success or, in the
          case of failure, the nature of the failure.  See ldap_error(3)
          for details.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The ldap_abandon() routine is deprecated in favor of the
          ldap_abandon_ext() routine.

          Deprecated interfaces generally remain in the library.  The macro
          LDAP_DEPRECATED can be defined to a non-zero value (e.g.,
          -DLDAP_DEPRECATED=1) when compiling program designed to use
          deprecated interfaces.  It is recommended that developers writing
          new programs, or updating old programs, avoid use of deprecated
          interfaces.  Over time, it is expected that documentation (and,
          eventually, support) for deprecated interfaces to be eliminated.
