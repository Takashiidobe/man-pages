   RINT(3P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               RINT(3P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          rint, rintf, rintl — round-to-nearest integral value


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <math.h>

          double rint(double x);
          float rintf(float x);
          long double rintl(long double x);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The functionality described on this reference page is aligned
          with the ISO C standard. Any conflict between the requirements
          described here and the ISO C standard is unintentional. This
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 defers to the ISO C standard.

          These functions shall return the integral value (represented as a
          double) nearest x in the direction of the current rounding mode.
          The current rounding mode is implementation-defined.

          If the current rounding mode rounds toward negative infinity,
          then rint() shall be equivalent to floor(3p).  If the current
          rounding mode rounds toward positive infinity, then rint() shall
          be equivalent to ceil(3p).  If the current rounding mode rounds
          towards zero, then rint() shall be equivalent to trunc(3p).  If
          the current rounding mode rounds towards nearest, then rint()
          differs from round(3p) in that halfway cases are rounded to even
          rather than away from zero.

          These functions differ from the nearbyint(), nearbyintf(), and
          nearbyintl() functions only in that they may raise the inexact
          floating-point exception if the result differs in value from the
          argument.

          An application wishing to check for error situations should set
          errno to zero and call feclearexcept(FE_ALL_EXCEPT) before
          calling these functions. On return, if errno is non-zero or
          fetestexcept(FE_INVALID | FE_DIVBYZERO | FE_OVERFLOW |
          FE_UNDERFLOW) is non-zero, an error has occurred.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Upon successful completion, these functions shall return the
          integer (represented as a double precision number) nearest x in
          the direction of the current rounding mode.  The result shall
          have the same sign as x.

          If x is NaN, a NaN shall be returned.

          If x is ±0 or ±Inf, x shall be returned.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          No errors are defined.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The integral value returned by these functions need not be
          expressible as an intmax_t.  The return value should be tested
          before assigning it to an integer type to avoid the undefined
          results of an integer overflow.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.
