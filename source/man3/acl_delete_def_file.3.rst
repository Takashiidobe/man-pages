   ACL_DELETE_DEF_FIL... BSD Library Functions Manual ACL_DELETE_DEF_FIL...

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

        acl_delete_def_file — delete a default ACL by filename


-------------------------------------------------------

::

        Linux Access Control Lists library (libacl, -lacl).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

        #include <sys/types.h>
        #include <sys/acl.h>

        int
        acl_delete_def_file(const char *path_p);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

        The acl_delete_def_file() function deletes a default ACL from the
        directory whose pathname is pointed to by the argument path_p.

        The effective user ID of the process must match the owner of the
        file or directory or the process must have the CAP_FOWNER
        capability for the request to succeed.

        If the argument path_p is not a directory, then the function fails.
        It is no error if the directory whose pathname is pointed to by the
        argument path_p does not have a default ACL.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

        The acl_delete_def_file() function returns the value 0 if
        successful; otherwise the value -1 is returned and the global
        variable errno is set to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

        If any of the following conditions occur, the acl_delete_def_file()
        function returns the value -1 and and sets errno to the
        corresponding value:

        [EINVAL]           The file referred to by path_p is not a
                           directory.

        [ENOTSUP]          The file system on which the file identified by
                           path_p is located does not support ACLs, or ACLs
                           are disabled.

        [EPERM]            The process does not have appropriate privilege
                           to perform the operation to delete the default
                           ACL.

        [EROFS]            This function requires modification of a file
                           system which is currently read-only.
