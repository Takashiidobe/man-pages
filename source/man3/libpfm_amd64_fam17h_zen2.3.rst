   LIBPFM(3)               Linux Programmer's Manual              LIBPFM(3)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          libpfm_amd64_fam17h_zen2 - support for AMD64 Family 17h model 31h
          processors


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <perfmon/pfmlib.h>

          PMU name: amd64_fam17h_zen2
          PMU desc: AMD64 Fam17h Zen2


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The library supports AMD Family 17h processors Zen2 core PMU in
          both 32 and 64-bit modes.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following modifiers are supported on AMD64 Family 17h Zen2
          core PMU:

          u      Measure at user level which includes privilege levels 1,
                 2, 3. This corresponds to PFM_PLM3.  This is a boolean
                 modifier.

          k      Measure at kernel level which includes privilege level 0.
                 This corresponds to PFM_PLM0.  This is a boolean modifier.

          h      Measure at while executing in host mode (when using
                 virtualization). This corresponds to PFM_PLMH.  This
                 modifier is available starting with Fam10h. This is a
                 boolean modifier.

          g      Measure at while executing in guest mode (when using
                 virtualization). This modifier is available starting with
                 Fam10h. This is a boolean modifier.

          i      Invert the meaning of the event. The counter will now
                 count cycles in which the event is not occurring. This is
                 a boolean modifier

          e      Enable edge detection, i.e., count only when there is a
                 state transition. This is a boolean modifier.

          c      Set the counter mask value. The mask acts as a threshold.
                 The counter will count the number of cycles in which the
                 number of occurrences of the event is greater or equal to
                 the threshold. This is an integer modifier with values in
                 the range [0:255].
