NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_journal_has_runtime_files, sd_journal_has_persistent_files -
          Query availability of runtime or persistent journal files


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <systemd/sd-journal.h>

          int sd_journal_has_runtime_files(sd_journal *j);

          int sd_journal_has_persistent_files(sd_journal *j);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          sd_journal_has_runtime_files() returns a positive value if
          runtime journal files (present in /run/systemd/journal/) have
          been found. Otherwise returns 0.

          sd_journal_has_persistent_files() returns a positive value if
          persistent journal files (present in /var/log/journal/) have been
          found. Otherwise returns 0.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Both sd_journal_has_runtime_files() and
          sd_journal_has_persistent_files() return -EINVAL if their
          argument is NULL.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          All functions listed here are thread-agnostic and only a single
          specific thread may operate on a given object during its entire
          lifetime. It's safe to allocate multiple independent objects and
          use each from a specific thread in parallel. However, it's not
          safe to allocate such an object in one thread, and operate or
          free it from any other, even if locking is used to ensure these
          threads don't operate on it at the very same time.

          These APIs are implemented as a shared library, which can be
          compiled and linked to with the libsystemd pkg-config(1) file.
