   MSR(4)                  Linux Programmer's Manual                 MSR(4)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          msr - x86 CPU MSR access device


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          /dev/cpu/CPUNUM/msr provides an interface to read and write the
          model-specific registers (MSRs) of an x86 CPU.  CPUNUM is the
          number of the CPU to access as listed in /proc/cpuinfo.

          The register access is done by opening the file and seeking to
          the MSR number as offset in the file, and then reading or writing
          in chunks of 8 bytes.  An I/O transfer of more than 8 bytes means
          multiple reads or writes of the same register.

          This file is protected so that it can be read and written only by
          the user root, or members of the group root.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The msr driver is not auto-loaded.  On modular kernels you might
          need to use the following command to load it explicitly before
          use:

              $ modprobe msr
