   SLAPO-ACCESSLOG(5)         File Formats Manual        SLAPO-ACCESSLOG(5)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          slapo-accesslog - Access Logging overlay to slapd


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ETCDIR/slapd.conf


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The Access Logging overlay can be used to record all accesses to
          a given backend database on another database. This allows all of
          the activity on a given database to be reviewed using arbitrary
          LDAP queries, instead of just logging to local flat text files.
          Configuration options are available for selecting a subset of
          operation types to log, and to automatically prune older log
          records from the logging database.  Log records are stored with
          audit schema (see below) to assure their readability whether
          viewed as LDIF or in raw form.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These slapd.conf options apply to the Access Logging overlay.
          They should appear after the overlay directive.

          logdb <suffix>
                 Specify the suffix of a database to be used for storing
                 the log records.  The specified database must be defined
                 elsewhere in the configuration and must support an ordered
                 return of results such as slapd-mdb(5) The access controls
                 on the log database should prevent general access. The
                 suffix entry of the log database will be created
                 automatically by this overlay. The log entries will be
                 generated as the immediate children of the suffix entry.

          logops <operations>
                 Specify which types of operations to log. The valid
                 operation types are abandon, add, bind, compare, delete,
                 extended, modify, modrdn, search, and unbind. Aliases for
                 common sets of operations are also available:

                 writes add, delete, modify, modrdn

                 reads  compare, search

                 session
                        abandon, bind, unbind

                 all    all operations

          logbase <operations> <baseDN>
                 Specify a set of operations that will only be logged if
                 they occur under a specific subtree of the database. The
                 operation types are as above for the logops setting, and
                 delimited by a '|' character.

          logold <filter>
                 Specify a filter for matching against Deleted and Modified
                 entries. If the entry matches the filter, the old contents
                 of the entry will be logged along with the current
                 request.

          logoldattr <attr> ...
                 Specify a list of attributes whose old contents are always
                 logged in Modify and ModRDN requests. Usually only the
                 contents of attributes that were actually modified will be
                 logged; by default no old attributes are logged for ModRDN
                 requests.

          logpurge <age> <interval>
                 Specify the maximum age for log entries to be retained in
                 the database, and how often to scan the database for old
                 entries. Both the age and interval are specified as a time
                 span in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. The time format
                 is [ddd+]hh:mm[:ss] i.e., the days and seconds components
                 are optional but hours and minutes are required. Except
                 for days, which can be up to 5 digits, each numeric field
                 must be exactly two digits. For example
                        logpurge 2+00:00 1+00:00
                 would specify that the log database should be scanned
                 every day for old entries, and entries older than two days
                 should be deleted. When using a log database that supports
                 ordered indexing on generalizedTime attributes, specifying
                 an eq index on the reqStart attribute will greatly benefit
                 the performance of the purge operation.

          logsuccess TRUE | FALSE
                 If set to TRUE then log records will only be generated for
                 successful requests, i.e., requests that produce a result
                 code of 0 (LDAP_SUCCESS).  If FALSE, log records are
                 generated for all requests whether they succeed or not.
                 The default is FALSE.

-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The accesslog overlay utilizes the "audit" schema described
          herein.  This schema is specifically designed for accesslog
          auditing and is not intended to be used otherwise.  It is also
          noted that the schema described here is a work in progress, and
          hence subject to change without notice.  The schema is loaded
          automatically by the overlay.

          The schema includes a number of object classes and associated
          attribute types as described below.

          The root entry of the underlying accesslog database makes use of
          the auditContainer class which is as follows:

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.0
                  NAME 'auditContainer'
                  DESC 'AuditLog container'
                  SUP top STRUCTURAL
                  MAY ( cn $ reqStart $ reqEnd ) )

          There is a basic auditObject class from which two additional
          classes, auditReadObject and auditWriteObject are derived. Object
          classes for each type of LDAP operation are further derived from
          these classes. This object class hierarchy is designed to allow
          flexible yet efficient searches of the log based on either a
          specific operation type's class, or on more general
          classifications. The definition of the auditObject class is as
          follows:

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.1
                  NAME 'auditObject'
                  DESC 'OpenLDAP request auditing'
                  SUP top STRUCTURAL
                  MUST ( reqStart $ reqType $ reqSession )
                  MAY ( reqDN $ reqAuthzID $ reqControls $ reqRespControls
              $
                      reqEnd $ reqResult $ reqMessage $ reqReferral $
              reqEntryUUID ) )

          Note that all of the OIDs used in the logging schema currently
          reside under the OpenLDAP Experimental branch. It is anticipated
          that they will migrate to a Standard branch in the future.

          An overview of the attributes follows: reqStart and reqEnd
          provide the start and end time of the operation, respectively.
          They use generalizedTime syntax. The reqStart attribute is also
          used as the RDN for each log entry.

          The reqType attribute is a simple string containing the type of
          operation being logged, e.g.  add, delete, search, etc. For
          extended operations, the type also includes the OID of the
          extended operation, e.g.  extended(1.1.1.1)

          The reqSession attribute is an implementation-specific identifier
          that is common to all the operations associated with the same
          LDAP session. Currently this is slapd's internal connection ID,
          stored in decimal.

          The reqDN attribute is the distinguishedName of the target of the
          operation. E.g., for a Bind request, this is the Bind DN. For an
          Add request, this is the DN of the entry being added. For a
          Search request, this is the base DN of the search.

          The reqAuthzID attribute is the distinguishedName of the user
          that performed the operation.  This will usually be the same name
          as was established at the start of a session by a Bind request
          (if any) but may be altered in various circumstances.

          The reqControls and reqRespControls attributes carry any controls
          sent by the client on the request and returned by the server in
          the response, respectively. The attribute values are just
          uninterpreted octet strings.

          The reqResult attribute is the numeric LDAP result code of the
          operation, indicating either success or a particular LDAP error
          code. An error code may be accompanied by a text error message
          which will be recorded in the reqMessage attribute.

          The reqReferral attribute carries any referrals that were
          returned with the result of the request.

          The reqEntryUUID attribute records the entryUUID attribute of the
          entry operated on, for an Add request, this is the entryUUID of
          the newly created entry.

          Operation-specific classes are defined with additional attributes
          to carry all of the relevant parameters associated with the
          operation:

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.4
                  NAME 'auditAbandon'
                  DESC 'Abandon operation'
                  SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST reqId )

          For the Abandon operation the reqId attribute contains the
          message ID of the request that was abandoned.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.5
                  NAME 'auditAdd'
                  DESC 'Add operation'
                  SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST reqMod )

          The Add class inherits from the auditWriteObject class. The Add
          and Modify classes are very similar. The reqMod attribute carries
          all of the attributes of the original entry being added.  (Or in
          the case of a Modify operation, all of the modifications being
          performed.) The values are formatted as
                 attribute:<+|-|=|#> [ value]
          Where '+' indicates an Add of a value, '-' for Delete, '=' for
          Replace, and '#' for Increment. In an Add operation, all of the
          reqMod values will have the '+' designator.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.6
                  NAME 'auditBind'
                  DESC 'Bind operation'
                  SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST ( reqVersion $ reqMethod ) )

          The Bind class includes the reqVersion attribute which contains
          the LDAP protocol version specified in the Bind as well as the
          reqMethod attribute which contains the Bind Method used in the
          Bind. This will be the string SIMPLE for LDAP Simple Binds or
          SASL(<mech>) for SASL Binds.  Note that unless configured as a
          global overlay, only Simple Binds using DNs that reside in the
          current database will be logged.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.7
                  NAME 'auditCompare'
                  DESC 'Compare operation'
                  SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST reqAssertion )

          For the Compare operation the reqAssertion attribute carries the
          Attribute Value Assertion used in the compare request.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.8
                  NAME 'auditDelete'
                  DESC 'Delete operation'
                  SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
                  MAY reqOld )

          The Delete operation needs no further parameters. However, the
          reqOld attribute may optionally be used to record the contents of
          the entry prior to its deletion. The values are formatted as
                 attribute: value
          The reqOld attribute is only populated if the entry being deleted
          matches the configured logold filter.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.9
                  NAME 'auditModify'
                  DESC 'Modify operation'
                  SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
                  MAY ( reqOld $ reqMod ) )

          The Modify operation contains a description of modifications in
          the reqMod attribute, which was already described above in the
          Add operation. It may optionally contain the previous contents of
          any modified attributes in the reqOld attribute, using the same
          format as described above for the Delete operation.  The reqOld
          attribute is only populated if the entry being modified matches
          the configured logold filter.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.10
                  NAME 'auditModRDN'
                  DESC 'ModRDN operation'
                  SUP auditWriteObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST ( reqNewRDN $ reqDeleteOldRDN )
                  MAY ( reqNewSuperior $ reqMod $ reqOld ) )

          The ModRDN class uses the reqNewRDN attribute to carry the new
          RDN of the request.  The reqDeleteOldRDN attribute is a Boolean
          value showing TRUE if the old RDN was deleted from the entry, or
          FALSE if the old RDN was preserved.  The reqNewSuperior attribute
          carries the DN of the new parent entry if the request specified
          the new parent.  The reqOld attribute is only populated if the
          entry being modified matches the configured logold filter and
          contains attributes in the logoldattr list.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.11
                  NAME 'auditSearch'
                  DESC 'Search operation'
                  SUP auditReadObject STRUCTURAL
                  MUST ( reqScope $ reqDerefAliases $ reqAttrsOnly )
                  MAY ( reqFilter $ reqAttr $ reqEntries $ reqSizeLimit $
                        reqTimeLimit ) )

          For the Search class the reqScope attribute contains the scope of
          the original search request, using the values specified for the
          LDAP URL format. I.e.  base, one, sub, or subord.  The
          reqDerefAliases attribute is one of never, finding, searching, or
          always, denoting how aliases will be processed during the search.
          The reqAttrsOnly attribute is a Boolean value showing TRUE if
          only attribute names were requested, or FALSE if attributes and
          their values were requested.  The reqFilter attribute carries the
          filter used in the search request.  The reqAttr attribute lists
          the requested attributes if specific attributes were requested.
          The reqEntries attribute is the integer count of how many entries
          were returned by this search request.  The reqSizeLimit and
          reqTimeLimit attributes indicate what limits were requested on
          the search operation.

              (  1.3.6.1.4.1.4203.666.11.5.2.12
                  NAME 'auditExtended'
                  DESC 'Extended operation'
                  SUP auditObject STRUCTURAL
                  MAY reqData )

          The Extended class represents an LDAP Extended Operation. As
          noted above, the actual OID of the operation is included in the
          reqType attribute of the parent class. If any optional data was
          provided with the request, it will be contained in the reqData
          attribute as an uninterpreted octet string.
