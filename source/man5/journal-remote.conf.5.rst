NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          journal-remote.conf, journal-remote.conf.d - Configuration files
          for the service accepting remote journal uploads


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          /etc/systemd/journal-remote.conf

          /etc/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf

          /run/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf

          /usr/lib/systemd/journal-remote.conf.d/*.conf


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These files configure various parameters of
          systemd-journal-remote.service(8). See systemd.syntax(7) for a
          general description of the syntax.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The default configuration is set during compilation, so
          configuration is only needed when it is necessary to deviate from
          those defaults. Initially, the main configuration file in
          /etc/systemd/ contains commented out entries showing the defaults
          as a guide to the administrator. Local overrides can be created
          by editing this file or by creating drop-ins, as described below.
          Using drop-ins for local configuration is recommended over
          modifications to the main configuration file.

          In addition to the "main" configuration file, drop-in
          configuration snippets are read from /usr/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/,
          /usr/local/lib/systemd/*.conf.d/, and /etc/systemd/*.conf.d/.
          Those drop-ins have higher precedence and override the main
          configuration file. Files in the *.conf.d/ configuration
          subdirectories are sorted by their filename in lexicographic
          order, regardless of in which of the subdirectories they reside.
          When multiple files specify the same option, for options which
          accept just a single value, the entry in the file sorted last
          takes precedence, and for options which accept a list of values,
          entries are collected as they occur in the sorted files.

          When packages need to customize the configuration, they can
          install drop-ins under /usr/. Files in /etc/ are reserved for the
          local administrator, who may use this logic to override the
          configuration files installed by vendor packages. Drop-ins have
          to be used to override package drop-ins, since the main
          configuration file has lower precedence. It is recommended to
          prefix all filenames in those subdirectories with a two-digit
          number and a dash, to simplify the ordering of the files.

          To disable a configuration file supplied by the vendor, the
          recommended way is to place a symlink to /dev/null in the
          configuration directory in /etc/, with the same filename as the
          vendor configuration file.

          All options are configured in the [Remote] section:

              Secure Sealing.

          SplitMode=
              One of "host" or "none".

          ServerKeyFile=
              SSL key in PEM format.

          ServerCertificateFile=
              SSL certificate in PEM format.
