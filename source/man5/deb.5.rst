   deb(5)                         dpkg suite                         deb(5)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          deb - Debian binary package format


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          filename.deb


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The .deb format is the Debian binary package file format. It is
          understood since dpkg 0.93.76, and is generated by default since
          dpkg 1.2.0 and 1.1.1elf (i386/ELF builds).

          The format described here is used since Debian 0.93; details of
          the old format are described in deb-old(5).


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The file is an ar archive with a magic value of !<arch>.  Only
          the common ar archive format is supported, with no long file name
          extensions, but with file names containing an optional trailing
          slash, which limits their length to 15 characters (from the 16
          allowed).  File sizes are limited to 10 ASCII decimal digits,
          allowing for up to approximately 9536.74 MiB member files.

          The tar archives currently allowed are, the old-style (v7)
          format, the pre-POSIX ustar format, a subset of the GNU format
          (new style long pathnames and long linknames, supported since
          dpkg 1.4.1.17; large file metadata since dpkg 1.18.24), and the
          POSIX ustar format (long names supported since dpkg 1.15.0).
          Unrecognized tar typeflags are considered an error.  Each tar
          entry size inside a tar archive is limited to 11 ASCII octal
          digits, allowing for up to 8 GiB tar entries.  The GNU large file
          metadata support permits 95-bit tar entry sizes and negative
          timestamps, and 63-bit UID, GID and device numbers.

          The first member is named debian-binary and contains a series of
          lines, separated by newlines. Currently only one line is present,
          the format version number, 2.0 at the time this manual page was
          written.  Programs which read new-format archives should be
          prepared for the minor number to be increased and new lines to be
          present, and should ignore these if this is the case.

          If the major number has changed, an incompatible change has been
          made and the program should stop. If it has not, then the program
          should be able to safely continue, unless it encounters an
          unexpected member in the archive (except at the end), as
          described below.

          The second required member is named control.tar.  It is a tar
          archive containing the package control information, either not
          compressed (supported since dpkg 1.17.6), or compressed with gzip
          (with .gz extension) or xz (with .xz extension, supported since
          1.17.6), as a series of plain files, of which the file control is
          mandatory and contains the core control information, the
          conffiles, triggers, shlibs and symbols files contain optional
          control information, and the preinst, postinst, prerm and postrm
          files are optional maintainer scripts.  The control tarball may
          optionally contain an entry for ‘.’, the current directory.

          The third, last required member is named data.tar.  It contains
          the filesystem as a tar archive, either not compressed (supported
          since dpkg 1.10.24), or compressed with gzip (with .gz
          extension), xz (with .xz extension, supported since dpkg 1.15.6),
          bzip2 (with .bz2 extension, supported since dpkg 1.10.24) or lzma
          (with .lzma extension, supported since dpkg 1.13.25).

          These members must occur in this exact order. Current
          implementations should ignore any additional members after
          data.tar.  Further members may be defined in the future, and (if
          possible) will be placed after these three. Any additional
          members that may need to be inserted after debian-binary and
          before control.tar or data.tar and which should be safely ignored
          by older programs, will have names starting with an underscore,
          ‘_’.

          Those new members which won't be able to be safely ignored will
          be inserted before data.tar with names starting with something
          other than underscores, or will (more likely) cause the major
          version number to be increased.
