NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          nfs4_acl - NFSv4 Access Control Lists


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          An ACL is a list of permissions associated with a file or
          directory and consists of one or more Access Control Entries
          (ACEs).  NFSv4 ACLs provide finer granularity than typical POSIX
          read/write/execute permissions and are similar to CIFS ACLs.

          A sample NFSv4 file ACL might look like the following (see the
          ACL FORMAT section for detailed information):

                 A::OWNER@:rwatTnNcCy
                 A::alice@nfsdomain.org:rxtncy
                 A::bob@nfsdomain.org:rwadtTnNcCy
                 A:g:GROUP@:rtncy
                 D:g:GROUP@:waxTC
                 A::EVERYONE@:rtncy
                 D::EVERYONE@:waxTC

          Some observations:

          -  In the example output above, the user `alice@nfsdomain.org'
             has the equivalent of "read" and "execute" permissions,
             `bob@nfsdomain.org' has "read" and "write", and both `GROUP@'
             and `EVERYONE@' have "read".

          -  NFSv4 ACLs are "default-deny"; that is, if a permission is not
             explicitly granted by an Allow ACE, it is denied.  Because of
             this, the two Deny ACEs above are superfluous and could be
             excluded by the server.  See the A WARNING ABOUT DENY ACES
             section for more information.

          -  NFSv4 servers may return an ACL slightly different than one
             you set.  For example, a server that always allows reading the
             attributes of a file may silently turn on the read-attributes
             permission, and a server that does not support separate write-
             data and append-data permissions, e.g., may choose to turn off
             both if you set only one.  In extreme cases the server may
             also reorder or combine ACEs.  As a general rule, however,
             servers will attempt to ensure that the ACLs they return are
             no more permissive than the ones you set.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          An NFSv4 ACL is written as an acl_spec, which is a comma- or tab-
          delimited string consisting of one or more ace_specs.  A single
          NFSv4 ACE is written as an ace_spec, which is a colon-delimited,
          4-field string in the following format:

                 type:flags:principal:permissions

      ACE TYPES:
          There are four types of ACEs, each represented by a single
          character.  An ACE must have exactly one type.

          A      Allow - allow principal to perform actions requiring
                 permissions.

          D      Deny - prevent principal from performing actions requiring
                 permissions.

          U      Audit - log any attempted access by principal which
                 requires permissions.  Requires one or both of the
                 successful-access and failed-access flags.  System-
                 dependent; not supported by all servers.

          L      Alarm - generate a system alarm at any attempted access by
                 principal which requires permissions.  Requires one or
                 both of the successful-access and failed-access flags.
                 System-dependent; not supported by all servers.

      ACE FLAGS:
          There are three kinds of ACE flags: group, inheritance, and
          administrative.  An Allow or Deny ACE may contain zero or more
          flags, while an Audit or Alarm ACE must contain at least one of
          the successful-access and failed-access flags.

          Note that ACEs are inherited from the parent directory's ACL at
          the time a file or subdirectory is created.  Accordingly,
          inheritance flags can be used only in ACEs in a directory's ACL
          (and are therefore stripped from inherited ACEs in a new file's
          ACL).  Please see the INHERITANCE FLAGS COMMENTARY section for
          more information.

          GROUP FLAG - can be used in any ACE

          g      group - indicates that principal represents a group
                 instead of a user.

          INHERITANCE FLAGS - can be used in any directory ACE

          d      directory-inherit - newly-created subdirectories will
                 inherit the ACE.

          f      file-inherit - newly-created files will inherit the ACE,
                 minus its inheritance flags.  Newly-created subdirectories
                 will inherit the ACE; if directory-inherit is not also
                 specified in the parent ACE, inherit-only will be added to
                 the inherited ACE.

          n      no-propagate-inherit - newly-created subdirectories will
                 inherit the ACE, minus its inheritance flags.

          i      inherit-only - the ACE is not considered in permissions
                 checks, but it is heritable; however, the inherit-only
                 flag is stripped from inherited ACEs.

          ADMINISTRATIVE FLAGS - can be used in Audit and Alarm ACEs

          S      successful-access - trigger an alarm/audit when principal
                 is allowed to perform an action covered by permissions.

          F      failed-access - trigger an alarm/audit when principal is
                 prevented from performing an action covered by
                 permissions.

      ACE PRINCIPALS:
          A principal is either a named user (e.g., `myuser@nfsdomain.org')
          or group (provided the group flag is also set), or one of three
          special principals: `OWNER@', `GROUP@', and `EVERYONE@':

          OWNER@ matches the file's owner

          GROUP@ matches the file's group

          EVERYONE@
                 always matches.  (Note this is different from the "other"
                 used in mode bits or POSIX ACLs, which does not match the
                 file's owner or group.)

      ACE PERMISSIONS:
          There are a variety of different ACE permissions (13 for files,
          14 for directories), each represented by a single character.  An
          ACE should have one or more of the following permissions
          specified:

          r      read-data (files) / list-directory (directories)

          w      write-data (files) / create-file (directories)

          a      append-data (files) / create-subdirectory (directories)

          x      execute (files) / change-directory (directories)

          d      delete - delete the file/directory.  Some servers will
                 allow a delete to occur if either this permission is set
                 in the file/directory or if the delete-child permission is
                 set in its parent directory.

          D      delete-child - remove a file or subdirectory from within
                 the given directory (directories only)

          t      read-attributes - read the attributes of the
                 file/directory.

          T      write-attributes - write the attributes of the
                 file/directory.

          n      read-named-attributes - read the named attributes of the
                 file/directory.

          N      write-named-attributes - write the named attributes of the
                 file/directory.

          c      read-ACL - read the file/directory NFSv4 ACL.

          C      write-ACL - write the file/directory NFSv4 ACL.

          o      write-owner - change ownership of the file/directory.

          y      synchronize - allow clients to use synchronous I/O with
                 the server.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Inheritance flags can be divided into two categories: "primary"
          (file-inherit and directory-inherit); and "secondary" (no-
          propagate-inherit and inherit-only), which are significant only
          insofar as they affect the two "primary" flags.

          The no-propagate-inherit and inherit-only flags can be tricky to
          remember: the former determines whether or not a new child
          directory's inherited ACE is itself heritable by a grandchild
          subdirectory; the latter determines whether or not a heritable
          ACE affects the parent directory itself (in addition to being
          heritable).  They can be used in-tandem.

          When a subdirectory inherits an ACE from its parent directory's
          ACL, this can happen in one of two different ways, depending on
          the server implementation:

          -  In the simple case, that exact same ACE is set in the
             subdirectory's ACL.

          -  In the other case, two different ACEs will instead be set in
             the subdirectory's ACL: one with all inheritance flags
             removed, and one with the inherit-only flag added.  The former
             is the "effective" inherited ACE (used in the subdirectory's
             own permissions checks); the latter is the "heritable"
             inherited ACE (when the subdirectory has directories created
             within it, they inherit it).  This approach makes it easier to
             modify access rights to the subdirectory itself without
             modifying its heritable ACEs. The Linux kernel server uses
             this approach.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Deny ACEs should be avoided whenever possible.  Although they are
          a valid part of NFSv4 ACLs, Deny ACEs can be confusing and
          complicated.  This stems primarily from the fact that, unlike
          POSIX ACLs and CIFS ACLs, the ordering of ACEs within NFSv4 ACLs
          affects how they are evaluated.

          First, it is important to note that (despite some unfortunate
          ambiguity in RFC3530) NFSv4 ACLs are "default-deny" in practice.
          That is, if a permission is not explicitly granted, it is denied.

          In general, when a principal is attempting to perform an action
          over NFSv4 which requires one or more permissions, an access
          check is performed.  The NFSv4 ACL (assuming one is present) is
          evaluated ACE-by-ACE until every one of those permissions has
          been addressed, or until the end of the ACL is reached.  If every
          requisite permission was granted by Allow ACEs and was not
          forbidden by Deny ACEs (see next paragraph), the action is
          allowed to proceed.  Otherwise, the action is forbidden.

          Note that each requisite permission is only addressed once --
          that is, after a permission has been explicitly Allowed or Denied
          once during an access check, any subsequent ACEs in the ACL which
          affect that permission are no longer considered.  This often
          introduces problematic ordering issues when Deny ACEs are
          present.

          Additionally, in some cases Group-Deny ACEs can be difficult (if
          not impossible) to enforce, since a server might not know about
          all of a given principal's memberships in remote groups, e.g.

          Because NFSv4 ACLs are "default-deny", the use of Deny ACEs can
          (and should) be avoided entirely in most cases.
