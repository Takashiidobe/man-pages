NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          deb-prerm - package pre-removal maintainer script


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          prerm


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          A package can perform several pre-removal actions via maintainer
          scripts, by including an executable prerm file in its control
          archive (i.e. DEBIAN/prerm during package creation).

          The script can be called in the following ways:

          prerm remove
                 Before the package is removed.

          old-prerm upgrade new-version
                 Before an upgrade.

          new-prerm failed-upgrade old-version new-version
                 If the above upgrade fails.

          prerm deconfigure in-favour new-package new-version
              [ removing old-package old-version ]
                 Before package is deconfigured while dependency is
                 replaced due to conflict.

          prerm remove in-favour new-package new-version
                 Before the package is replaced due to conflict.
