NAME

::

          slapo-dds - Dynamic Directory Services overlay to slapd


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ETCDIR/slapd.conf


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The dds overlay to slapd(8) implements dynamic objects as per RFC
          2589.  The name dds stands for Dynamic Directory Services.  It
          allows one to define dynamic objects, characterized by the
          dynamicObject objectClass.

          Dynamic objects have a limited lifetime, determined by a time-to-
          live (TTL) that can be refreshed by means of a specific refresh
          extended operation.  This operation allows one to set the Client
          Refresh Period (CRP), namely the period between refreshes that is
          required to preserve the dynamic object from expiration.  The
          expiration time is computed by adding the requested TTL to the
          current time.  When dynamic objects reach the end of their
          lifetime without being further refreshed, they are automatically
          deleted.  There is no guarantee of immediate deletion, so clients
          should not count on it.

          Dynamic objects can have subordinates, provided these also are
          dynamic objects.  RFC 2589 does not specify what the behavior of
          a dynamic directory service should be when a dynamic object with
          (dynamic) subordinates expires.  In this implementation, the
          lifetime of dynamic objects with subordinates is prolonged until
          all the dynamic subordinates expire.

          This slapd.conf(5) directive adds the dds overlay to the current
          database:

          overlay dds

          The database must have a rootdn specified, otherwise, the dds
          overlay will not be able to delete expired objects. The dds
          overlay may be used with any backend that implements the add,
          modify, search, and delete operations.  Since its use may result
          in many internal entry lookups, adds and deletes, it should be
          best used in conjunction with backends that have reasonably good
          write performances.

          The config directives that are specific to the dds overlay are
          prefixed by dds-, to avoid potential conflicts with directives
          specific to the underlying database or to other stacked overlays.

          dds-max-ttl <time>
                 Specifies the max TTL value.  This is also the default TTL
                 newly created dynamic objects receive, unless
                 dds-default-ttl is set.  When the client with a refresh
                 extended operation requests a TTL higher than it,
                 sizeLimitExceeded is returned.  This value must be between
                 86400 (1 day, the default) and 31557600 (1 year plus 6
                 hours, as per RFC 2589).

          dds-min-ttl <time>
                 Specifies the min TTL value; clients requesting a lower
                 TTL by means of the refresh extended operation actually
                 obtain this value as CRP.  If set to 0 (the default), no
                 lower limit is set.

          dds-default-ttl <time>
                 Specifies the default TTL value that newly created dynamic
                 objects get.  If set to 0 (the default), the dds-max-ttl
                 is used.

          dds-interval <time>
                 Specifies the interval between expiration checks; defaults
                 to 1 hour.

          dds-tolerance <time>
                 Specifies an extra time that is added to the timer that
                 actually wakes up the thread that will delete an expired
                 dynamic object.  So the nominal lifetime of the entry is
                 that specified in the entryTtl attribute, but its lifetime
                 will actually be entryTtl + tolerance.  Note that there is
                 no guarantee that the lifetime of a dynamic object will be
                 exactly the requested TTL; due to implementation details,
                 it may be longer, which is allowed by RFC 2589.  By
                 default, tolerance is 0.

          dds-max-dynamicObjects <num>
                 Specifies the maximum number of dynamic objects that can
                 simultaneously exist within a naming context.  This allows
                 one to limit the amount of resources (mostly in terms of
                 run-queue size) that are used by dynamic objects.  By
                 default, no limit is set.

          dds-state {TRUE|false}
                 Specifies if the Dynamic Directory Services feature is
                 enabled or not.  By default it is; however, a proxy does
                 not need to keep track of dynamic objects itself, it only
                 needs to inform the frontend that support for dynamic
                 objects is available.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The dds overlay restricts the refresh operation by requiring
          manage access to the entryTtl attribute (see slapd.access(5) for
          details about the manage access privilege).  Since the entryTtl
          is an operational, NO-USER-MODIFICATION attribute, no direct
          write access to it is possible.  So the dds overlay turns refresh
          extended operation into an internal modification to the value of
          the entryTtl attribute with the relax control set.

          RFC 2589 recommends that anonymous clients should not be allowed
          to refresh a dynamic object.  This can be implemented by
          appropriately crafting access control to obtain the desired
          effect.

          Example: restrict refresh to authenticated clients

                 access to attrs=entryTtl
                      by users manage
                      by * read

          Example: restrict refresh to the creator of the dynamic object

                 access to attrs=entryTtl
                      by dnattr=creatorsName manage
                      by * read

          Another suggested usage of dynamic objects is to implement
          dynamic meetings; in this case, all the participants to the
          meeting are allowed to refresh the meeting object, but only the
          creator can delete it (otherwise it will be deleted when the TTL
          expires)

          Example: assuming participant is a valid DN-valued attribute,
          allow users to start a meeting and to join it; restrict refresh
          to the participants; restrict delete to the creator

                 access to dn.base="cn=Meetings"
                           attrs=children
                      by users write

                 access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                           attrs=entry
                      by dnattr=creatorsName write
                      by * read

                 access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                           attrs=participant
                      by dnattr=creatorsName write
                      by users selfwrite
                      by * read

                 access to dn.onelevel="cn=Meetings"
                           attrs=entryTtl
                      by dnattr=participant manage
                      by * read


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This implementation of RFC 2589 provides a restricted
          interpretation of how dynamic objects replicate.  Only the
          provider takes care of handling dynamic object expiration, while
          consumers simply see the dynamic object as a plain object.

          When replicating these objects, one needs to explicitly exclude
          the dynamicObject class and the entryTtl attribute.  This
          implementation of RFC 2589 introduces a new operational
          attribute, entryExpireTimestamp, that contains the expiration
          timestamp.  This must be excluded from replication as well.

          The quick and dirty solution is to set schemacheck=off in the
          syncrepl configuration and, optionally, exclude the operational
          attributes from replication, using

                 syncrepl ...
                      exattrs=entryTtl,entryExpireTimestamp

          In any case the overlay must be either statically built in or
          run-time loaded by the consumer, so that it is aware of the
          entryExpireTimestamp operational attribute; however, it must not
          be configured in the shadow database.  Currently, there is no
          means to remove the dynamicObject class from the entry; this may
          be seen as a feature, since it allows one to see the dynamic
          properties of the object.
