NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          slapd-dnssrv - DNS SRV referral backend to slapd


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ETCDIR/slapd.conf


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The DNSSRV backend to slapd(8) serves up referrals based upon SRV
          resource records held in the Domain Name System.

          This backend is experimental.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The DNSSRV backend has no backend nor database specific options.
          It is configured simply by "database dnssrv" followed a suffix
          directive, e.g. suffix "".


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The dnssrv backend does not honor all ACL semantics as described
          in slapd.access(5).  In fact, this backend only implements the
          search operation when the manageDSAit control (RFC 3296) is used,
          otherwise for every operation a referral, whenever appropriate,
          or an error is returned.  Currently, there is no means to
          condition the returning of the referral by means of ACLs; no
          access control is implemented, except for read (=r) access to the
          returned entries, which is actually provided by the frontend.
          Note, however, that the information returned by this backend is
          collected through the DNS, so it is public by definition.
