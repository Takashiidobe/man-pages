::

          faillog - login failure logging file


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          /var/log/faillog maintains a count of login failures and the
          limits for each account.

          The file contains fixed length records, indexed by numerical UID.
          Each record contains the count of login failures since the last
          successful login; the maximum number of failures before the
          account is disabled; the line on which the last login failure
          occurred; the date of the last login failure; and the duration
          (in seconds) during which the account will be locked after a
          failure.

          The structure of the file is:

              struct    faillog {
                   short   fail_cnt;
                   short   fail_max;
                   char    fail_line[12];
                   time_t  fail_time;
                   long    fail_locktime;
              };
