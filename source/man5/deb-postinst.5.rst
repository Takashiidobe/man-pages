   deb-postinst(5)                dpkg suite                deb-postinst(5)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          deb-postinst - package post-installation maintainer script


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          postinst


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          A package can perform several post-installation actions via
          maintainer scripts, by including an executable postinst file in
          its control archive (i.e. DEBIAN/postinst during package
          creation).

          The script can be called in the following ways:

          postinst configure old-version
                 After the package was installed.

          postinst triggered trigger-name...
                 After the package was triggered.

          old-postinst abort-upgrade new-version
                 If prerm fails during upgrade or fails on failed upgrade.

          old-postinst abort-remove
                 If prerm fails during removal.

          postinst abort-deconfigure in-favour new-package new-version
                 [ removing old-package old-version ]
                 If prerm fails during deconfiguration of a package.

          postinst abort-remove in-favour new-package new-version
                 If prerm fails during replacement due to conflict.
