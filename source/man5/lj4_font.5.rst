          lj4_font - groff fonts for use with devlj4


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Nominally, all Hewlett-Packard LaserJet 4-series and newer
          printers have the same internal fonts: 45 scalable fonts and one
          bitmapped Lineprinter font.  The scalable fonts are available in
          sizes between 0.25 points and 999.75 points, in 0.25-point
          increments; the Lineprinter font is available only in 8.5-point
          size.

          The LaserJet font files included with groff assume that all
          printers since the LaserJet 4 are identical.  There are some
          differences between fonts in the earlier and more recent
          printers, however.  The LaserJet 4 printer used Agfa Intellifont
          technology for 35 of the internal scalable fonts; the remaining
          10 scalable fonts were TrueType.  Beginning with the
          LaserJet 4000-series printers introduced in 1997, all scalable
          internal fonts have been TrueType.  The number of printable
          glyphs differs slightly between Intellifont and TrueType fonts
          (generally, the TrueType fonts include more glyphs), and there
          are some minor differences in glyph metrics.  Differences among
          printer models are described in the PCL 5 Comparison Guide and
          the PCL 5 Comparison Guide Addendum (for printers introduced
          since approximately 2001).

          LaserJet printers reference a glyph by a combination of a
          256-glyph symbol set and an index within that symbol set.  Many
          glyphs appear in more than one symbol set; all combinations of
          symbol set and index that reference the same glyph are
          equivalent.  For each glyph, hpftodit(1) searches a list of
          symbol sets, and selects the first set that contains the glyph.
          The printing code generated by hpftodit is an integer that
          encodes a numerical value for the symbol set in the high byte(s),
          and the index in the low byte.  See groff_font(5) for a complete
          description of the font file format; symbol sets are described in
          greater detail in the PCL 5 Printer Language Technical Reference
          Manual.

          Two of the scalable fonts, Symbol and Wingdings, are bound to
          256-glyph symbol sets; the remaining scalable fonts, as well as
          the Lineprinter font, support numerous symbol sets, sufficient to
          enable printing of more than 600 glyphs.

          The metrics generated by hpftodit assume that the DESC file
          contains values of 1200 for res and 6350 for unitwidth, or any
          combination (e.g., 2400 and 3175) for which
          res × unitwidth = 7620000.  Although HP PCL 5 LaserJet printers
          support an internal resolution of 7200 units per inch, they use a
          16-bit signed integer for cursor positioning; if devlj4 is to
          support U.S. ledger paper (11 in × 17 in; in = inch), the maximum
          usable resolution is 32767 ÷ 17, or 1927 units per inch, which
          rounds down to 1200 units per inch.  If the largest required
          paper size is less (e.g., 8.5 in × 11 in, or A5), a greater res
          (and lesser unitwidth) can be specified.

          Font metrics for Intellifont fonts were provided by Tagged Font
          Metric (TFM) files originally developed by Agfa/Compugraphic.
          The TFM files provided for these fonts supported 600+ glyphs and
          contained extensive lists of kerning pairs.

          To accommodate developers who had become accustomed to TFM files,
          HP also provided TFM files for the 10 TrueType fonts included in
          the LaserJet 4.  The TFM files for TrueType fonts generally
          included less information than the Intellifont TFMs, supporting
          fewer glyphs, and in most cases, providing no kerning
          information.  By the time the LaserJet 4000 printer was
          introduced, most developers had migrated to other means of
          obtaining font metrics, and support for new TFM files was very
          limited.  The TFM files provided for the TrueType fonts in the
          LaserJet 4000 support only the Latin 2 (ISO 8859-2) symbol set,
          and include no kerning information; consequently, they are of
          little value for any but the most rudimentary documents.

          Because the Intellifont TFM files contain considerably more
          information, they generally are preferable to the TrueType TFM
          files even for use with the TrueType fonts in the newer printers.
          The metrics for the TrueType fonts are very close, though not
          identical, to those for the earlier Intellifont fonts of the same
          names.  Although most output using the Intellifont metrics with
          the newer printers is quite acceptable, a few glyphs may fail to
          print as expected.  The differences in glyph metrics may be
          particularly noticeable with composite parentheses, brackets, and
          braces used by eqn(1).  A script, located in /usr/local/share/
          groff/1.23.0/font/devlj4/generate, can be used to adjust the
          metrics for these glyphs in the special font “S” for use with
          printers that have all TrueType fonts.

          At the time HP last supported TFM files, only version 1.0 of the
          Unicode standard was available.  Consequently, many glyphs
          lacking assigned code points were assigned by HP to the Private
          Use Area (PUA).  Later versions of the Unicode standard included
          code points outside the PUA for many of these glyphs.  The HP-
          supplied TrueType TFM files use the PUA assignments; TFM files
          generated from more recent TrueType font files require the later
          Unicode values to access the same glyphs.  Consequently, two
          different mapping files may be required: one for the HP-supplied
          TFM files, and one for more recent TFM files.
