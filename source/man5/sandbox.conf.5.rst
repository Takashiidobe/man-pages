NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sandbox.conf - user config file for the SELinux sandbox


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          When running sandbox with the -C argument, it will be confined
          using control groups and a system administrator can specify how
          the sandbox is confined.

          Everything after "#" is ignored, as are empty lines.  All
          arguments should be separated by and equals sign ("=").

          These keywords are allowed.

                 NAME   The name of the sandbox control group.  Default is
                        "sandbox".

                 CPUAFFINITY
                        Which cpus to assign sandbox to.  The default is
                        ALL, but users can specify a comma-separated list
                        with dashes ("-") to represent ranges.  Ex: 0-2,5

                 MEMUSAGE
                        How much memory to allow sandbox to use.  The
                        default is 80%.  Users can specify either a
                        percentage or a value in the form of a number
                        followed by one of the suffixes K, M, G to denote
                        kilobytes, megabytes or gigabytes respectively.
                        Ex: 50% or 100M

                 CPUUSAGE
                        Percentage of cpu sandbox should be allowed to use.
                        The default is 80%.  Specify a value followed by a
                        percent sign ("%"). Ex: 50%
