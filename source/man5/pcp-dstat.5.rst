   PCP-DSTAT(5)               File Formats Manual              PCP-DSTAT(5)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp-dstat - pcp-dstat configuration file


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp-dstat is a customizable performance metrics reporting tool.
          It has a ``plugin'' architecture, where a set of pre-defined
          plugins offer small sets of columnar metric reports, and pcp-
          dstat command line options select which of these plugins are used
          in the generated report.

          Each plugin is defined in a section of a configuration file.  A
          typical installation will provide many configuration files, and
          often multiple sections (plugins) within each file.

          Configuration files are read from both a system directory and the
          users home directory ($PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/dstat and
          $HOME/.pcp/dstat).


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The configuration files have an ini-style syntax consisting of
          sections (plugins) and options within sections.  A section begins
          with the name of the plugin in square brackets and continues
          until the next section begins.  An example section with two
          options follows:

              [plugin]
              option = value
              metric.option = value2

          A line comment starts with a hash sign (``#'') or a semicolon
          (``;'').  Inline comments are not supported.

          There are some options which apply to the plugin as a whole, and
          anything else is considered to be a column definition.  Column
          definitions map directly to individual PCP metrics.

      The [plugin] options
          label (string)
              The overall title to be used for this plugin.  In the special
              case of metrics with instances being reported as a group (see
              grouptype below) this string may contain the %I pattern,
              which will be substituted with the name of the instance -
              refer to the cpu, disk, net and int(errupts) plugins for
              examples of this special syntax.  Undefined by default, set
              automatically to the section (plugin) name.

          width (integer)
              The column width used for metrics in this plugin.  The
              default is 5.

          precision (integer)
              The maximum precision to be used when reporting columns in
              floating point for this plugin.  Undefined by default, set
              automatically based on width.

          printtype (character)
              Indicates the reporting style for metric values in this
              plugin.  Possible settings are d(ecimal), f(loat), p(ercent),
              s(tring), b(its), t(ime).  By default a setting will be used
              based on the metric type and semantic - refer to PMAPI(3) for
              further details of PCP metric metadata.

          colorstep (integer)
              Indicates a ``step'' at which the next color will be
              transitioned to, when reporting metric values.  As metric
              values change on each sample, the colorstep is used to
              determine the increments beyond which a new color is to be
              selected.  Defaults to 1000.

          grouptype (integer)
              For plugins with metrics sharing the same instance domain, it
              is possible to request more complex grouping behaviour.  The
              default behaviour is to not use instance grouping, and to
              report each instance of the metric in a separate column (the
              load plugin is an example of this, using the kernel.all.load
              metric).

              The grouping can be set at three distinct levels - 1, 2 or 3.
              Level 1 displays instances of metrics only (no totals) - this
              is the equivalent of using the --cpu plugin on the pcp-dstat
              command line with specific processors' utilization displayed,
              e.g. displaying CPU numbers 4, 5 and 12 (-C 4,5,12).  Level 2
              displays the total column - the sum of all instances for the
              specified metric(s) in this plugin.  Level 3 is a combination
              of both modes, for example using the pcp-dstat --cpu plugin
              with options -C 4,5,12,total.

          instances (comma-separated-value string)
              Defines the instances to be reported for the metric.  The
              default is to report all instances for set-values metrics.

          cullinsts (regex pattern)
              An optional regular expression that can be used to cull
              metric instances from the aggregation ('total') in generated
              reports.  For example it is common to exclude loopback
              devices from the network interface reports, this is achieved
              using this option.  Default is to report on all instances (no
              culling).

      The [plugin] metrics
          Each plugin must have at least one metric associated with it.
          Any key that is not one of the above global plugin options is
          considered to be a metric specification or a metric option.
          These keys define the metrics and their report formatting.

          First and foremost, each column is typically represented by an
          individual metric (if the metric is set-valued - i.e. it has
          instances - this will result in multiple columns).  This is
          specified by a new key (column) being set to a metric
          specification.  The column (key) name is an arbitrary word using
          alphabetic characters.  The metric specification is any PCP
          metric name or derived metric specification, allowing basic
          arithmetic calculations to be used to form this individual
          column.  The derived metric syntax is described on the
          pmRegisterDerived(3) manual page.

          Some examples of both forms of metric specification are given
          below in the ``EXAMPLES'' section.  Once a column has been
          associated with a metric, other options specific to that column
          can be set using a dot-separated syntax.

          Metric options

          metric.label
              The subtitle to be used for the reported values of this
              metric.  The default label is the column name from the
              configuration file.

              When set-valued PCP metrics (i.e. with instances) are being
              used, it is often convenient to specify either the instance
              number or instance name in the heading.  This is achieved
              using format specifiers - ``%d'' or ``%i'' for instance
              numbers (e.g. replaced by ``6'' for the sixth processor), and
              ``%s'' or ``%I'' for instance names (e.g. replaced by
              ``eth0'' for the ethernet interface).  Available instance
              names for any metric can be discovered via the pminfo(1) or
              pmprobe(1) commands.

          metric.width
              The column width to be used when reporting values for this
              metric.

          metric.unit (string)
              Defines the unit/scale conversion for the metric.  Needs to
              be dimension-compatible and is used with non-string metrics.
              For allowed values, see pmrep(1).

          metric.type (string)
              If set to raw rate conversion for the metric will be
              disabled.

          metric.precision (integer)
              Defines precision for floating point values.

          metric.limit (string)
              Defines value limit filter for numeric metric values.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following example defines a virtual filesystem plugin, with
          two columns, defined using three PCP metrics - vfs.files.count,
          vfs.inodes.count and vfs.inodes.free.  The inodes metrics are
          combined using the derived metric notation.

              [vfs]
              width = 6
              label = filesystem
              files = vfs.files.count
              inode = vfs.inodes.count - vfs.inodes.free
              inode.label = inodes

          The system default pcp-dstat plugin files contain many more
          examples.

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).

          For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
          pmGetOptions(3).
