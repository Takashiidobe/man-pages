NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          deb822 - Debian RFC822 control data format


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The package management system manipulates data represented in a
          common format, known as control data, stored in control files.
          Control files are used for source packages, binary packages and
          the .changes files which control the installation of uploaded
          files (dpkg's internal databases are in a similar format).


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          A control file consists of one or more paragraphs of fields (the
          paragraphs are also sometimes referred to as stanzas).  The
          paragraphs are separated by empty lines.  Parsers may accept
          lines consisting solely of U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 TAB as
          paragraph separators, but control files should use empty lines.
          Some control files allow only one paragraph; others allow
          several, in which case each paragraph usually refers to a
          different package.  (For example, in source packages, the first
          paragraph refers to the source package, and later paragraphs
          refer to binary packages generated from the source.)  The
          ordering of the paragraphs in control files is significant.

          Each paragraph consists of a series of data fields.  Each field
          consists of the field name followed by a colon (U+003A ‘:’), and
          then the data/value associated with that field.  The field name
          is composed of US-ASCII characters excluding control characters,
          space, and colon (i.e., characters in the ranges U+0021 ‘!’
          through U+0039 ‘9’, and U+003B ‘;’ through U+007E ‘~’,
          inclusive).  Field names must not begin with the comment
          character (U+0023 ‘#’), nor with the hyphen character (U+002D
          ‘-’).

          The field ends at the end of the line or at the end of the last
          continuation line (see below).  Horizontal whitespace (U+0020
          SPACE and U+0009 TAB) may occur immediately before or after the
          value and is ignored there; it is conventional to put a single
          space after the colon.  For example, a field might be:
                 Package: dpkg
          the field name is Package and the field value dpkg.

          Empty field values are only permitted in source package control
          files (debian/control).  Such fields are ignored.

          A paragraph must not contain more than one instance of a
          particular field name.

          There are three types of fields:

          simple The field, including its value, must be a single line.
                 Folding of the field is not permitted.  This is the
                 default field type if the definition of the field does not
                 specify a different type.

          folded The value of a folded field is a logical line that may
                 span several lines.  The lines after the first are called
                 continuation lines and must start with a U+0020 SPACE or a
                 U+0009 TAB.  Whitespace, including any newlines, is not
                 significant in the field values of folded fields.

                 This folding method is similar to RFC5322, allowing
                 control files that contain only one paragraph and no
                 multiline fields to be read by parsers written for
                 RFC5322.

          multiline
                 The value of a multiline field may comprise multiple
                 continuation lines.  The first line of the value, the part
                 on the same line as the field name, often has special
                 significance or may have to be empty.  Other lines are
                 added following the same syntax as the continuation lines
                 of the folded fields.  Whitespace, including newlines, is
                 significant in the values of multiline fields.

          Whitespace must not appear inside names (of packages,
          architectures, files or anything else) or version numbers, or
          between the characters of multi-character version relationships.

          The presence and purpose of a field, and the syntax of its value
          may differ between types of control files.

          Field names are not case-sensitive, but it is usual to capitalize
          the field names using mixed case as shown below.  Field values
          are case-sensitive unless the description of the field says
          otherwise.

          Paragraph separators (empty lines) and lines consisting only of
          U+0020 SPACE and U+0009 TAB, are not allowed within field values
          or between fields.  Empty lines in field values are usually
          escaped by representing them by a U+0020 SPACE followed by a dot
          (U+002E ‘.’).

          Lines starting with U+0023 ‘#’, without any preceding whitespace
          are comments lines that are only permitted in source package
          control files (debian/control) and in deb-origin(5) files.  These
          comment lines are ignored, even between two continuation lines.
          They do not end logical lines.

          All control files must be encoded in UTF-8.
