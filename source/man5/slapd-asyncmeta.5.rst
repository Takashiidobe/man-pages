   SLAPD-ASYNCMETA(5)         File Formats Manual        SLAPD-ASYNCMETA(5)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          slapd-asyncmeta - asynchronous metadirectory backend to slapd


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ETCDIR/slapd.conf


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The asyncmeta backend to slapd(8) performs basic LDAP proxying
          with respect to a set of remote LDAP servers, called "targets".
          The information contained in these servers can be presented as
          belonging to a single Directory Information Tree (DIT).

          A good knowledge of the functionality of the slapd-meta(5)
          backend  is recommended.   This  backend has been designed as an
          asynchronous version of the meta backend. Unlike meta , the
          operation handling threads are no longer pending on the response
          from the remote server, thus decreasing the number of threads
          necessary to handle the same load. While asyncmeta maintains the
          functionality of meta and has a largely similar codebase, some
          changes in operation and some new configuration directives have
          been added. Some configuration options, such as conn-pool-max ,
          conn-ttl , single-conn , and use-temporary-conn have been
          removed, as they are no longer relevant.

          New connection handling:

          Unlike meta, which caches bound connections, the asyncmeta works
          with a configured maximum number of connections per target.  For
          each request redirected to a target, a different connection is
          selected.  Each connection has a queue, to which the request is
          added before it is sent to the remote server, and is removed
          after the last response for that request is received.
           For each new request, the connection with the smallest number of
          pending requests is selected, or using round-robin if the numbers
          are equal.

          Overlays:

          Due to implementation specifics, there is no guarantee that any
          of the existing OpenLDAP overlays will work with asyncmeta
          backend.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Refer to slapd-meta(5) for configuration examples.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These slapd.conf options apply to the ASYNCMETA backend database.
          That is, they must follow a "database asyncmeta" line and come
          before any subsequent "backend" or "database" lines.  Other
          database options are described in the slapd.conf(5) manual page.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Target configuration starts with the "uri" directive.  All the
          configuration directives that are not specific to targets should
          be defined first for clarity, including those that are common to
          all backends.  They are:

          default-target none
                 This directive forces the backend to reject all those
                 operations that must resolve to a single target in case
                 none or multiple targets are selected.  They include: add,
                 delete, modify, modrdn; compare is not included, as well
                 as bind since, as they don't alter entries, in case of
                 multiple matches an attempt is made to perform the
                 operation on any candidate target, with the constraint
                 that at most one must succeed.  This directive can also be
                 used when processing targets to mark a specific target as
                 default.

          dncache-ttl {DISABLED|forever|<ttl>}
                 This directive sets the time-to-live of the DN cache.
                 This caches the target that holds a given DN to speed up
                 target selection in case multiple targets would result
                 from an uncached search; forever means cache never
                 expires; disabled means no DN caching; otherwise a valid (
                 > 0 ) ttl is required, in the format illustrated for the
                 idle-timeout directive.

          onerr {CONTINUE|report|stop}
                 This directive allows one to select the behavior in case
                 an error is returned by one target during a search.  The
                 default, continue, consists in continuing the operation,
                 trying to return as much data as possible.  If the value
                 is set to stop, the search is terminated as soon as an
                 error is returned by one target, and the error is
                 immediately propagated to the client.  If the value is set
                 to report, the search is continued to the end but, in case
                 at least one target returned an error code, the first non-
                 success error code is returned.

          max-timeout-ops <number>
                 Specify the number of consecutive timed out requests,
                 after which the connection will be considered faulty and
                 dropped.

          max-pending-ops <number>
                 The maximum number of pending requests stored in a
                 connection's queue.  The default is 128. When this number
                 is exceeded, LDAP_BUSY will be returned to the client.

          max-target-conns <number>
                 The maximum number of connections per target. Unlike
                 slapd-meta(5), no new connections will be created once
                 this number is reached. The default value is 255.

          norefs <NO|yes>
                 If yes, do not return search reference responses.  By
                 default, they are returned unless request is LDAPv2.  If
                 set before any target specification, it affects all
                 targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

          noundeffilter <NO|yes>
                 If yes, return success instead of searching if a filter is
                 undefined or contains undefined portions.  By default, the
                 search is propagated after replacing undefined portions
                 with (!(objectClass=*)), which corresponds to the empty
                 result set.  If set before any target specification, it
                 affects all targets, unless overridden by any per-target
                 directive.

          protocol-version {0,2,3}
                 This directive indicates what protocol version must be
                 used to contact the remote server.  If set to 0 (the
                 default), the proxy uses the same protocol version used by
                 the client, otherwise the requested protocol is used.  The
                 proxy returns unwillingToPerform if an operation that is
                 incompatible with the requested protocol is attempted.  If
                 set before any target specification, it affects all
                 targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

          pseudoroot-bind-defer {YES|no}
                 This directive, when set to yes, causes the authentication
                 to the remote servers with the pseudo-root identity (the
                 identity defined in each idassert-bind directive) to be
                 deferred until actually needed by subsequent operations.
                 Otherwise, all binds as the rootdn are propagated to the
                 targets.

          quarantine <interval>,<num>[;<interval>,<num>[...]]
                 Turns on quarantine of URIs that returned
                 LDAP_UNAVAILABLE, so that an attempt to reconnect only
                 occurs at given intervals instead of any time a client
                 requests an operation.  The pattern is: retry only after
                 at least interval seconds elapsed since last attempt, for
                 exactly num times; then use the next pattern.  If num for
                 the last pattern is "+", it retries forever; otherwise, no
                 more retries occur.  This directive must appear before any
                 target specification; it affects all targets with the same
                 pattern.

          rebind-as-user {NO|yes}
                 If this option is given, the client's bind credentials are
                 remembered for rebinds, when trying to re-establish a
                 broken connection, or when chasing a referral, if
                 chase-referrals is set to yes.

          session-tracking-request {NO|yes}
                 Adds session tracking control for all requests.  The
                 client's IP and hostname, and the identity associated to
                 each request, if known, are sent to the remote server for
                 informational purposes.  This directive is incompatible
                 with setting protocol-version to 2.  If set before any
                 target specification, it affects all targets, unless
                 overridden by any per-target directive.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Target specification starts with a "uri" directive:

          uri <protocol>://[<host>]/<naming context> [...]
                 Identical to meta.  See slapd-meta(5) for details.

          acl-authcDN <administrative DN for access control purposes>
                 DN which is used to query the target server for acl
                 checking, as in the LDAP backend; it is supposed to have
                 read access on the target server to attributes used on the
                 proxy for acl checking.  There is no risk of giving away
                 such values; they are only used to check permissions.  The
                 acl-authcDN identity is by no means implicitly used by the
                 proxy when the client connects anonymously.

          acl-passwd <password>
                 Password used with the acl-authcDN above.

          bind-timeout <microseconds>
                 This directive defines the timeout, in microseconds, used
                 when polling for response after an asynchronous bind
                 connection. See slapd-meta(5) for details.

          chase-referrals {YES|no}
                 enable/disable automatic referral chasing, which is
                 delegated to the underlying libldap, with rebinding
                 eventually performed if the rebind-as-user directive is
                 used.  The default is to chase referrals.  If set before
                 any target specification, it affects all targets, unless
                 overridden by any per-target directive.

          client-pr {accept-unsolicited|DISABLE|<size>}
                 This feature allows one to use RFC 2696 Paged Results
                 control when performing search operations with a specific
                 target, irrespective of the client's request. See
                 slapd-meta(5) for details.

          default-target [<target>]
                 The "default-target" directive can also be used during
                 target specification.  With no arguments it marks the
                 current target as the default.  The optional number marks
                 target <target> as the default one, starting from 1.
                 Target <target> must be defined.

          filter <pattern>
                 This directive allows specifying a regex(5) pattern to
                 indicate what search filter terms are actually served by a
                 target.

                 In a search request, if the search filter matches the
                 pattern the target is considered while fulfilling the
                 request; otherwise the target is ignored. There may be
                 multiple occurrences of the filter directive for each
                 target.

          idassert-authzFrom <authz-regexp>
                 if defined, selects what local identities are authorized
                 to exploit the identity assertion feature.  The string
                 <authz-regexp> follows the rules defined for the authzFrom
                 attribute.  See slapd.conf(5), section related to
                 authz-policy, for details on the syntax of this field.

          idassert-bind bindmethod=none|simple|sasl [binddn=<simple DN>]
                 [credentials=<simple password>] [saslmech=<SASL mech>]
                 [secprops=<properties>] [realm=<realm>]
                 [authcId=<authentication ID>] [authzId=<authorization ID>]
                 [authz={native|proxyauthz}] [mode=<mode>] [flags=<flags>]
                 [starttls=no|yes|critical] [tls_cert=<file>]
                 [tls_key=<file>] [tls_cacert=<file>]
                 [tls_cacertdir=<path>]
                 [tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
                 [tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]
                 [tls_cipher_suite=<ciphers>] [tls_ecname=<names>]
                 [tls_protocol_min=<major>[.<minor>]]
                 [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all] Allows one to define the
                 parameters of the authentication method that is internally
                 used by the proxy to authorize connections that are
                 authenticated by other databases. See slapd-meta(5) for
                 details.

          idle-timeout <time>
                 This directive causes a a persistent connection  to  be
                 dropped after it  has been idle for the specified time.
                 The connection will be re-created the next time it is
                 selected for use. A connection is considered idle if no
                 attempts have been made by the backend to use it to send a
                 request to the backend server. If there are still pending
                 requests in its queue, the connection will be dropped
                 after the last request one has either received a result or
                 has timed out.

                 [<d>d][<h>h][<m>m][<s>[s]]

                 where <d>, <h>, <m> and <s> are respectively treated as
                 days, hours, minutes and seconds.  If set before any
                 target specification, it affects all targets, unless
                 overridden by any per-target directive.

          keepalive <idle>:<probes>:<interval>
                 The keepalive parameter sets the values of idle, probes,
                 and interval used to check whether a socket is alive; idle
                 is the number of seconds a connection needs to remain idle
                 before TCP starts sending keepalive probes; probes is the
                 maximum number of keepalive probes TCP should send before
                 dropping the connection; interval is interval in seconds
                 between individual keepalive probes.  Only some systems
                 support the customization of these values; the keepalive
                 parameter is ignored otherwise, and system-wide settings
                 are used.

          tcp-user-timeout <milliseconds>
                 If non-zero, corresponds to the TCP_USER_TIMEOUT set on
                 the target connections, overriding the operating system
                 setting.  Only some systems support the customization of
                 this parameter, it is ignored otherwise and system-wide
                 settings are used.

          map {attribute|objectclass} [<local name>|*] {<foreign name>|*}
                 This maps object classes and attributes as in the LDAP
                 backend.  See slapd-ldap(5).

          network-timeout <time>
                 Sets the network timeout value after which
                 poll(2)/select(2) following a connect(2) returns in case
                 of no activity while sending an operation to the remote
                 target.  The value is in milliseconds, and it can be
                 specified as for idle-timeout.  If set before any target
                 specification, it affects all targets, unless overridden
                 by any per-target directive.

          nretries {forever|never|<nretries>}
                 This directive defines how many times forwarding an
                 operation should be retried in case of temporary failure
                 in contacting a target. The number of retries is per
                 operation, so if a bind to the target is necessary first,
                 the remaining number is decremented. If defined before any
                 target specification, it applies to all targets (by
                 default, 3 times); the global value can be overridden by
                 redefinitions inside each target specification.

          rewrite* ...
                 The rewrite options are identical to the meta backend. See
                 the REWRITING section of slapd-meta(5).

          subtree-{exclude|include} <rule>
                 This directive allows one to indicate what subtrees are
                 actually served by a target. See slapd-meta(5) for
                 details.

          suffixmassage <local suffix> <remote suffix>
                 slapd-asyncmeta does not support the rewrite engine used
                 by the LDAP and META backends.  suffixmassage can be used
                 to perform DN suffix rewriting, the same way as the
                 obsoleted suffixmassage directive previously used by the
                 LDAP backend.

          t-f-support {NO|yes|discover}
                 enable if the remote server supports absolute filters (see
                 RFC 4526 for details).  If set to discover, support is
                 detected by reading the remote server's root DSE.  If set
                 before any target specification, it affects all targets,
                 unless overridden by any per-target directive.

          timeout [<op>=]<val> [...]
                 This directive allows one to set per-operation timeouts.
                 Operations can be

                 <op> ::= bind, add, delete, modrdn, modify, compare,
                 search

                 By default, the timeout for all operations is 2 seconds.

                 See slapd-meta(5) for details.

          tls {none|[try-]start|[try-]propagate|ldaps}
                 B [starttls=no] [tls_cert=<file>] [tls_key=<file>]
                 [tls_cacert=<file>] [tls_cacertdir=<path>]
                 [tls_reqcert=never|allow|try|demand]
                 [tls_reqsan=never|allow|try|demand]
                 [tls_cipher_suite=<ciphers>] [tls_ecname=<names>]
                 [tls_crlcheck=none|peer|all]
                 Specify TLS settings regular connections.

                 If the first parameter is not "none" then this configures
                 the TLS settings to be used for regular connections.  The
                 StartTLS extended operation will be used when establishing
                 the connection unless the URI directive protocol scheme is
                 ldaps://.  In that case this keyword may only be set to
                 "ldaps" and the StartTLS operation will not be used.

                 propagate issues the StartTLS operation only if the
                 original connection did.  The try- prefix instructs the
                 proxy to continue operations if the StartTLS operation
                 failed; its use is highly deprecated.  The TLS settings
                 default to the same as the main slapd TLS settings, except
                 for tls_reqcert which defaults to "demand", tls_reqsan
                 which defaults to "allow", and starttls which is
                 overshadowed by the first keyword and thus ignored.

                 If set before any target specification, it affects all
                 targets, unless overridden by any per-target directive.

          ACL behavior is identical to meta. See slapd-meta(5).


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The asyncmeta backend does not honor all ACL semantics as
          described in slapd.access(5).  In general, access checking is
          delegated to the remote server(s).  Only read (=r) access to the
          entry pseudo-attribute and to the other attribute values of the
          entries returned by the search operation is honored, which is
          performed by the frontend.
