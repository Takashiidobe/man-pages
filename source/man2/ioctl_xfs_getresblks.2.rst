   IOCTL-XFS-GETRESBLKS(2)    System Calls Manual   IOCTL-XFS-GETRESBLKS(2)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ioctl_xfs_getresblks - query and set XFS free space reservation
          information


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <xfs/xfs_fs.h>

          int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_GET_RESBLKS, struct xfs_fsop_resblks
          *arg);
          int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_SET_RESBLKS, struct xfs_fsop_resblks
          *arg);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Query or set the free space reservation information.  These
          blocks are reserved by the filesystem as a final attempt to
          prevent metadata update failures due to insufficient space.  Only
          the system administrator can use these ioctls, because overriding
          the defaults is extremely dangerous.

          This functionality is intended only for use by XFS filesystem
          developers.

          The reservation information is conveyed in a structure of the
          following form:

              struct xfs_fsop_resblks {
                   __u64  resblks;
                   __u64  resblks_avail;
              };

          resblks is the number of blocks that the filesystem will try to
          maintain to prevent critical out of space situations.

          resblks_avail is the number of reserved blocks remaining.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

          EFSBADCRC
                 Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
                 query.

          EFSCORRUPTED
                 Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
                 query.

          EINVAL The specified allocation group number is not valid for
                 this filesystem.

          EIO    An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

          EPERM  Caller does not have permission to call this ioctl.
