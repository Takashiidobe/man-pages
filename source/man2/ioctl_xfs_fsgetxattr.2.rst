   IOCTL-XFS-FSGETXATTR(2)    System Calls Manual   IOCTL-XFS-FSGETXATTR(2)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ioctl_xfs_fsgetxattr - query information for an open file


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <linux/fs.h>

          int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTR, struct fsxattr *arg);
          int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA, struct fsxattr *arg);
          int ioctl(int fd, XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR, struct fsxattr *arg);


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Query or set additional attributes associated with files in
          various file systems.  The attributes are conveyed in a structure
          of the form:

              struct fsxattr {
                   __u32         fsx_xflags;
                   __u32         fsx_extsize;
                   __u32         fsx_nextents;
                   __u32         fsx_projid;
                   __u32         fsx_cowextsize;
                   unsigned char fsx_pad[8];
              };

          fsx_xflags are extended flags that apply to this file.  Refer to
          the section XFS INODE FLAGS below for more information.

          fsx_extsize is the preferred extent allocation size for data
          blocks mapped to this file, in units of filesystem blocks.  If
          this value is zero, the filesystem will choose a default option,
          which is currently zero.  If XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR is called with
          XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE set in fsx_xflags and this field set to zero,
          the XFLAG will also be cleared.

          fsx_nextents is the number of data extents in this file.  If
          XFS_IOC_FSGETXATTRA was used, then this is the number of extended
          attribute extents in the file.

          fsx_projid is the project ID of this file.

          fsx_cowextsize is the preferred extent allocation size for copy
          on write operations targeting this file, in units of filesystem
          blocks.  If this field is zero, the filesystem will choose a
          default option, which is currently 128 filesystem blocks.  If
          XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR is called with XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE set in
          fsx_xflags and this field set to zero, the XFLAG will also be
          cleared.

          fsx_pad must be zeroed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This field can be a combination of the following:

          XFS_XFLAG_REALTIME
                 The file is a realtime file.  This bit can only be changed
                 on a file when it has no allocated extents.

          XFS_XFLAG_PREALLOC
                 The file has preallocated space.

          XFS_XFLAG_IMMUTABLE
                 The file is immutable - it cannot be modified, deleted or
                 renamed, no link can be created to this file and no data
                 can be written to the file.  Only the superuser or a
                 process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can
                 set or clear this flag.  If this flag is set before a
                 XFS_IOC_FSSETXATTR call and would not be cleared by the
                 call, then no other attributes can be changed and EPERM
                 will be returned.

          XFS_XFLAG_APPEND
                 The file is append-only - it can only be opened in append
                 mode for writing.  For directories, this means that files
                 cannot be unlinked from this directory.  Only the
                 superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE
                 capability can set or clear this flag.

          XFS_XFLAG_SYNC
                 All writes to the file are synchronous.  If set on a
                 directory and the /proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_sync tunable is
                 set to 1, new files and subdirectories created in the
                 directory will also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_NOATIME
                 When the file is accessed, its atime record is not
                 modified.  If set on a directory and the
                 /proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_noatime tunable is set to 1, new
                 files and subdirectories created in the directory will
                 also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_NODUMP
                 The file should be skipped by backup utilities.  If set on
                 a directory and the /proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nodump
                 tunable is set to 1, new files and subdirectories created
                 in the directory will also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_RTINHERIT
                 Realtime inheritance bit - new files created in the
                 directory will be automatically created as realtime files.
                 If set on a directory, new subdirectories created in the
                 directory will also have the inheritance flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_PROJINHERIT
                 Project inheritance bit - new files and directories
                 created in this directory will inherit the project ID of
                 this directory.  If set on a directory, new subdirectories
                 created in the directory will also have the inheritance
                 flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_NOSYMLINKS
                 Disallows creation of symbolic links in the directory.
                 This flag can only be set on a directory.  If set on a
                 directory and the /proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nosymlinks
                 tunable is set to 1, new files and subdirectories created
                 in the directory will also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_EXTSIZE
                 Extent size bit - if a basic extent size value is set on
                 the file then the allocator will allocate in multiples of
                 the set size for this file (see fsx_extsize below).  The
                 extent size can only be changed on a file when it has no
                 allocated extents.

          XFS_XFLAG_EXTSZINHERIT
                 Extent size inheritance bit - new files and directories
                 created in the directory will inherit the extent size
                 value (see fsx_extsize below) of the parent directory.
                 New subdirectories created in the directory will inherit
                 the extent size inheritance bit.

          XFS_XFLAG_NODEFRAG
                 No defragment file bit - the file should be skipped during
                 a defragmentation operation.  If set on a directory and
                 the /proc/sys/fs/xfs/inherit_nodefrag tunable is set to 1,
                 new files and subdirectories created in the directory will
                 also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_FILESTREAM
                 Filestream allocator bit - allows a directory to reserve
                 an allocation group for exclusive use by files created
                 within that directory.  Files being written in other
                 directories will not use the same allocation group and so
                 files within different directories will not interleave
                 extents on disk.  The reservation is only active while
                 files are being created and written into the directory.
                 If set on a directory, new files and subdirectories
                 created in the directory will also have the flag set.

          XFS_XFLAG_DAX
                 If the filesystem lives on directly accessible persistent
                 memory, reads and writes to this file will go straight to
                 the persistent memory, bypassing the page cache.  If set
                 on a directory, new files and subdirectories created in
                 the directory will also have the flag set.  This flag
                 cannot be set on filesystems which have the reflink
                 feature enabled.

          XFS_XFLAG_COWEXTSIZE
                 Copy on Write Extent size bit - if a CoW extent size value
                 is set on the file, the allocator will allocate extents
                 for staging a copy on write operation in multiples of the
                 set size for this file (see fsx_cowextsize below).  If set
                 on a directory, new files and subdirectories created in
                 the directory will have both the flag and the CoW extent
                 size value set.

          XFS_XFLAG_HASATTR
                 The file has extended attributes associated with it.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On error, -1 is returned, and errno is set to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Error codes can be one of, but are not limited to, the following:

          EACCESS
                 Caller does not have sufficient access to change the
                 attributes.

          EFAULT The kernel was not able to copy into the userspace buffer.

          EFSBADCRC
                 Metadata checksum validation failed while performing the
                 query.

          EFSCORRUPTED
                 Metadata corruption was encountered while performing the
                 query.

          EINVAL One of the arguments was not valid.

          EIO    An I/O error was encountered while performing the query.

          ENOMEM There was insufficient memory to perform the query.

          EPERM  Caller did not have permission to change the attributes.
