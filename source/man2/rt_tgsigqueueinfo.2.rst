   RT_SIGQUEUEINFO(2)      Linux Programmer's Manual     RT_SIGQUEUEINFO(2)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          rt_sigqueueinfo, rt_tgsigqueueinfo - queue a signal and data


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <linux/signal.h>     /* Definition of SI_* constants */
          #include <sys/syscall.h>      /* Definition of SYS_* constants */
          #include <unistd.h>

          int syscall(SYS_rt_sigqueueinfo, pid_t tgid,
                      int sig, siginfo_t *info);
          int syscall(SYS_rt_tgsigqueueinfo, pid_t tgid, pid_t tid,
                      int sig, siginfo_t *info);

          Note: There are no glibc wrappers for these system calls; see
          NOTES.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The rt_sigqueueinfo() and rt_tgsigqueueinfo() system calls are
          the low-level interfaces used to send a signal plus data to a
          process or thread.  The receiver of the signal can obtain the
          accompanying data by establishing a signal handler with the
          sigaction(2) SA_SIGINFO flag.

          These system calls are not intended for direct application use;
          they are provided to allow the implementation of sigqueue(3) and
          pthread_sigqueue(3).

          The rt_sigqueueinfo() system call sends the signal sig to the
          thread group with the ID tgid.  (The term "thread group" is
          synonymous with "process", and tid corresponds to the traditional
          UNIX process ID.)  The signal will be delivered to an arbitrary
          member of the thread group (i.e., one of the threads that is not
          currently blocking the signal).

          The info argument specifies the data to accompany the signal.
          This argument is a pointer to a structure of type siginfo_t,
          described in sigaction(2) (and defined by including
          <sigaction.h>).  The caller should set the following fields in
          this structure:

          si_code
                 This should be one of the SI_* codes in the Linux kernel
                 source file include/asm-generic/siginfo.h.  If the signal
                 is being sent to any process other than the caller itself,
                 the following restrictions apply:

                 *  The code can't be a value greater than or equal to
                    zero.  In particular, it can't be SI_USER, which is
                    used by the kernel to indicate a signal sent by
                    kill(2), and nor can it be SI_KERNEL, which is used to
                    indicate a signal generated by the kernel.

                 *  The code can't (since Linux 2.6.39) be SI_TKILL, which
                    is used by the kernel to indicate a signal sent using
                    tgkill(2).

          si_pid This should be set to a process ID, typically the process
                 ID of the sender.

          si_uid This should be set to a user ID, typically the real user
                 ID of the sender.

          si_value
                 This field contains the user data to accompany the signal.
                 For more information, see the description of the last
                 (union sigval) argument of sigqueue(3).

          Internally, the kernel sets the si_signo field to the value
          specified in sig, so that the receiver of the signal can also
          obtain the signal number via that field.

          The rt_tgsigqueueinfo() system call is like rt_sigqueueinfo(),
          but sends the signal and data to the single thread specified by
          the combination of tgid, a thread group ID, and tid, a thread in
          that thread group.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          On success, these system calls return 0.  On error, they return
          -1 and errno is set to indicate the error.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          EAGAIN The limit of signals which may be queued has been reached.
                 (See signal(7) for further information.)

          EINVAL sig, tgid, or tid was invalid.

          EPERM  The caller does not have permission to send the signal to
                 the target.  For the required permissions, see kill(2).

          EPERM  tgid specifies a process other than the caller and
                 info->si_code is invalid.

          ESRCH  rt_sigqueueinfo(): No thread group matching tgid was
                 found.

          rt_tgsigqueinfo(): No thread matching tgid and tid was found.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The rt_sigqueueinfo() system call was added to Linux in version
          2.2.  The rt_tgsigqueueinfo() system call was added to Linux in
          version 2.6.31.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          These system calls are Linux-specific.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Since these system calls are not intended for application use,
          there are no glibc wrapper functions; use syscall(2) in the
          unlikely case that you want to call them directly.

          As with kill(2), the null signal (0) can be used to check if the
          specified process or thread exists.
