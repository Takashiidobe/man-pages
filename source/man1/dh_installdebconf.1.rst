   DH_INSTALLDEBCONF(1)            Debhelper           DH_INSTALLDEBCONF(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installdebconf - install files used by debconf in package
          build directories


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installdebconf [debhelper options] [-n] [-- params]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installdebconf is a debhelper program that is responsible for
          installing files used by debconf into package build directories.

          It also automatically generates the postrm commands needed to
          interface with debconf. The commands are added to the maintainer
          scripts by dh_installdeb. See dh_installdeb(1) for an explanation
          of how that works.

          Note that if you use debconf, your package probably needs to
          depend on it (it will be added to ${misc:Depends} by this
          program).

          Note that for your config script to be called by dpkg, your
          postinst needs to source debconf's confmodule. dh_installdebconf
          does not install this statement into the postinst automatically
          as it is too hard to do it right.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          debian/package.config
              This is the debconf config script, and is installed into the
              DEBIAN directory in the package build directory.

              Inside the script, the token #DEBHELPER# is replaced with
              shell script snippets generated by other debhelper commands.

          debian/package.templates
              This is the debconf templates file, and is installed into the
              DEBIAN directory in the package build directory.

          debian/po/
              If this directory is present, this program will automatically
              use po2debconf(1) to generate merged templates files that
              include the translations from there.

              For this to work, your package should build-depend on po-
              debconf.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n, --no-scripts
              Do not modify postrm script.

          -- params
              Pass the params to po2debconf.
