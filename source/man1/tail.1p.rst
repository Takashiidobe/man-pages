   TAIL(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               TAIL(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          tail — copy the last part of a file


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tail [-f] [-c number|-n number] [file]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The tail utility shall copy its input file to the standard output
          beginning at a designated place.

          Copying shall begin at the point in the file indicated by the -c
          number or -n number options. The option-argument number shall be
          counted in units of lines or bytes, according to the options -n
          and -c.  Both line and byte counts start from 1.

          Tails relative to the end of the file may be saved in an internal
          buffer, and thus may be limited in length. Such a buffer, if any,
          shall be no smaller than {LINE_MAX}*10 bytes.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The tail utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
          that '+' may be recognized as an option delimiter as well as '-'.

          The following options shall be supported:

          -c number The application shall ensure that the number option-
                    argument is a decimal integer, optionally including a
                    sign.  The sign shall affect the location in the file,
                    measured in bytes, to begin the copying:

                        ┌─────┬────────────────────────────────────────┐
                        │Sign │             Copying Starts             │
                        ├─────┼────────────────────────────────────────┤
                        │ +   │ Relative to the beginning of the file. │
                        │ -   │ Relative to the end of the file.       │
                        │none │ Relative to the end of the file.       │
                        └─────┴────────────────────────────────────────┘
                    The application shall ensure that if the sign of the
                    number option-argument is '+', the number option-
                    argument is a non-zero decimal integer.

                    The origin for counting shall be 1; that is, -c +1
                    represents the first byte of the file, -c -1 the last.

          -f        If the input file is a regular file or if the file
                    operand specifies a FIFO, do not terminate after the
                    last line of the input file has been copied, but read
                    and copy further bytes from the input file when they
                    become available. If no file operand is specified and
                    standard input is a pipe or FIFO, the -f option shall
                    be ignored. If the input file is not a FIFO, pipe, or
                    regular file, it is unspecified whether or not the -f
                    option shall be ignored.

          -n number This option shall be equivalent to -c number, except
                    the starting location in the file shall be measured in
                    lines instead of bytes. The origin for counting shall
                    be 1; that is, -n +1 represents the first line of the
                    file, -n -1 the last.

          If neither -c nor -n is specified, -n 10 shall be assumed.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          file      A pathname of an input file. If no file operand is
                    specified, the standard input shall be used.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard input shall be used if no file operand is specified,
          and shall be used if the file operand is '-' and the
          implementation treats the '-' as meaning standard input.
          Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
          FILES section.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If the -c option is specified, the input file can contain
          arbitrary data; otherwise, the input file shall be a text file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          tail:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments and input files).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The designated portion of the input file shall be written to
          standard output.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The -c option should be used with caution when the input is a
          text file containing multi-byte characters; it may produce output
          that does not start on a character boundary.

          Although the input file to tail can be any type, the results
          might not be what would be expected on some character special
          device files or on file types not described by the System
          Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. Since this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 does not specify the block size used when doing
          input, tail need not read all of the data from devices that only
          perform block transfers.

          When using tail to process pathnames, and the -c option is not
          specified, it is recommended that LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE
          and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or C in the environment, since
          pathnames can contain byte sequences that do not form valid
          characters in some locales, in which case the utility's behavior
          would be undefined. In the POSIX locale each byte is a valid
          single-byte character, and therefore this problem is avoided.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The -f option can be used to monitor the growth of a file that is
          being written by some other process. For example, the command:

              tail -f fred

          prints the last ten lines of the file fred, followed by any lines
          that are appended to fred between the time tail is initiated and
          killed. As another example, the command:

              tail -f -c 15 fred

          prints the last 15 bytes of the file fred, followed by any bytes
          that are appended to fred between the time tail is initiated and
          killed.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          This version of tail was created to allow conformance to the
          Utility Syntax Guidelines. The historical -b option was omitted
          because of the general non-portability of block-sized units of
          text. The -c option historically meant ``characters'', but this
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 indicates that it means ``bytes''. This
          was selected to allow reasonable implementations when multi-byte
          characters are possible; it was not named -b to avoid confusion
          with the historical -b.

          The origin of counting both lines and bytes is 1, matching all
          widespread historical implementations. Hence tail -n +0 is not
          conforming usage because it attempts to output line zero; but
          note that tail -n 0 does conform, and outputs nothing.

          Earlier versions of this standard allowed the following forms in
          the SYNOPSIS:

              tail -[number][b|c|l][f] [file]
              tail +[number][b|c|l][f] [file]

          These forms are no longer specified by POSIX.1‐2008, but may be
          present in some implementations.

          The restriction on the internal buffer is a compromise between
          the historical System V implementation of 4096 bytes and the BSD
          32768 bytes.

          The -f option has been implemented as a loop that sleeps for 1
          second and copies any bytes that are available. This is
          sufficient, but if more efficient methods of determining when new
          data are available are developed, implementations are encouraged
          to use them.

          Historical documentation indicates that tail ignores the -f
          option if the input file is a pipe (pipe and FIFO on systems that
          support FIFOs). On BSD-based systems, this has been true; on
          System V-based systems, this was true when input was taken from
          standard input, but it did not ignore the -f flag if a FIFO was
          named as the file operand. Since the -f option is not useful on
          pipes and all historical implementations ignore -f if no file
          operand is specified and standard input is a pipe, this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 requires this behavior. However, since the -f option
          is useful on a FIFO, this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 also requires
          that if a FIFO is named, the -f option shall not be ignored.
          Earlier versions of this standard did not state any requirement
          for the case where no file operand is specified and standard
          input is a FIFO. The standard has been updated to reflect current
          practice which is to treat this case the same as a pipe on
          standard input.  Although historical behavior does not ignore the
          -f option for other file types, this is unspecified so that
          implementations are allowed to ignore the -f option if it is
          known that the file cannot be extended.
