   DH_AUTO_INSTALL(1)              Debhelper             DH_AUTO_INSTALL(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_install - automatically runs make install or similar


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_install [build system options] [debhelper options]
          [-- params]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_install is a debhelper program that tries to
          automatically install built files. It does so by running the
          appropriate command for the build system it detects the package
          uses. For example, if there's a Makefile and it contains a
          install target, then this is done by running make (or MAKE, if
          the environment variable is set). If there is a setup.py or
          Build.PL, it is used. Note that the Ant build system does not
          support installation, so dh_auto_install will not install files
          built using Ant.

          Unless --destdir option is specified, the files are installed
          into debian/package/ if there is only one binary package. In the
          multiple binary package case, the files are instead installed
          into debian/tmp/, and should be moved from there to the
          appropriate package build directory using dh_install(1).

          DESTDIR is used to tell make where to install the files.  If the
          Makefile was generated by MakeMaker from a Makefile.PL, it will
          automatically set PREFIX=/usr too, since such Makefiles need
          that.

          This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
          work, or tries to use the wrong install target, you're encouraged
          to skip using dh_auto_install at all, and just run make install
          manually.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common
          build system selection and control options.

          --destdir=directory
              Install files into the specified directory. If this option is
              not specified, destination directory is determined
              automatically as described in the "DESCRIPTION" section.

          -- params
              Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters
              that dh_auto_install usually passes.
