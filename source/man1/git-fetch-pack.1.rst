   GIT-FETCH-PACK(1)              Git Manual              GIT-FETCH-PACK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-fetch-pack - Receive missing objects from another repository


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git fetch-pack [--all] [--quiet|-q] [--keep|-k] [--thin] [--include-tag]
                  [--upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>]
                  [--depth=<n>] [--no-progress]
                  [-v] <repository> [<refs>...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Usually you would want to use git fetch, which is a higher level
          wrapper of this command, instead.

          Invokes git-upload-pack on a possibly remote repository and asks
          it to send objects missing from this repository, to update the
          named heads. The list of commits available locally is found out
          by scanning the local refs/ hierarchy and sent to git-upload-pack
          running on the other end.

          This command degenerates to download everything to complete the
          asked refs from the remote side when the local side does not have
          a common ancestor commit.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --all
              Fetch all remote refs.

          --stdin
              Take the list of refs from stdin, one per line. If there are
              refs specified on the command line in addition to this
              option, then the refs from stdin are processed after those on
              the command line.

              If --stateless-rpc is specified together with this option
              then the list of refs must be in packet format (pkt-line).
              Each ref must be in a separate packet, and the list must end
              with a flush packet.

          -q, --quiet
              Pass -q flag to git unpack-objects; this makes the cloning
              process less verbose.

          -k, --keep
              Do not invoke git unpack-objects on received data, but create
              a single packfile out of it instead, and store it in the
              object database. If provided twice then the pack is locked
              against repacking.

          --thin
              Fetch a "thin" pack, which records objects in deltified form
              based on objects not included in the pack to reduce network
              traffic.

          --include-tag
              If the remote side supports it, annotated tags objects will
              be downloaded on the same connection as the other objects if
              the object the tag references is downloaded. The caller must
              otherwise determine the tags this option made available.

          --upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>
              Use this to specify the path to git-upload-pack on the remote
              side, if is not found on your $PATH. Installations of sshd
              ignores the user’s environment setup scripts for login shells
              (e.g. .bash_profile) and your privately installed git may not
              be found on the system default $PATH. Another workaround
              suggested is to set up your $PATH in ".bashrc", but this flag
              is for people who do not want to pay the overhead for
              non-interactive shells by having a lean .bashrc file (they
              set most of the things up in .bash_profile).

          --exec=<git-upload-pack>
              Same as --upload-pack=<git-upload-pack>.

          --depth=<n>
              Limit fetching to ancestor-chains not longer than n.
              git-upload-pack treats the special depth 2147483647 as
              infinite even if there is an ancestor-chain that long.

          --shallow-since=<date>
              Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
              include all reachable commits after <date>.

          --shallow-exclude=<revision>
              Deepen or shorten the history of a shallow repository to
              exclude commits reachable from a specified remote branch or
              tag. This option can be specified multiple times.

          --deepen-relative
              Argument --depth specifies the number of commits from the
              current shallow boundary instead of from the tip of each
              remote branch history.

          --no-progress
              Do not show the progress.

          --check-self-contained-and-connected
              Output "connectivity-ok" if the received pack is
              self-contained and connected.

          -v
              Run verbosely.

          <repository>
              The URL to the remote repository.

          <refs>...
              The remote heads to update from. This is relative to $GIT_DIR
              (e.g. "HEAD", "refs/heads/master"). When unspecified, update
              from all heads the remote side has.

              If the remote has enabled the options
              uploadpack.allowTipSHA1InWant,
              uploadpack.allowReachableSHA1InWant, or
              uploadpack.allowAnySHA1InWant, they may alternatively be
              40-hex sha1s present on the remote.
