   STG-POP(1)                    StGit Manual                    STG-POP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          stg-pop - Pop one or more patches from the stack


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          stg pop [options] [--] [<patch1>] [<patch2>] [<patch3>..<patch4>]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Pop the topmost patch or a range of patches from the stack. The
          command fails if there are conflicts or local changes (and --keep
          was not specified).

          A series of pop and push operations are performed so that only
          the patches passed on the command line are popped from the stack.
          Some of the push operations may fail because of conflicts ("stg
          undo" would revert the last push operation).


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -a, --all
              Pop all the applied patches.

          -s, --spill
              Pop a patch, keeping its modifications in the tree.

          -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
              Pop the specified number of patches.

              With a negative number, pop all but that many patches.

          -k, --keep
              Keep the local changes.
