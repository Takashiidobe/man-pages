---------------------------------------------------------

::

          perf top [-e <EVENT> | --event=EVENT] [<options>]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This command generates and displays a performance counter profile
          in real time.

              groups with different amount of events. WARNING: This should
              be used on grouped events.

          -F <freq>, --freq=<freq>

          -z, --zero
              Zero history across display updates.

          -s, --sort
              Sort by key(s): pid, comm, dso, symbol, parent, srcline,
              weight, local_weight, abort, in_tx, transaction, overhead,
              sample, period. Please see description of --sort in the
              perf-report man page.

          --fields=
              Specify output field - multiple keys can be specified in CSV
              format. Following fields are available: overhead,
              overhead_sys, overhead_us, overhead_children, sample and
              period. Also it can contain any sort key(s).

                  By default, every sort keys not specified in --field will be appended
                  automatically.

          -n, --show-nr-samples
              Show a column with the number of samples.

          --show-total-period
              Show a column with the sum of periods.

          --dsos
              Only consider symbols in these dsos. This option will affect
              the percentage of the overhead column. See --percentage for
              more info.

          --comms
              Only consider symbols in these comms. This option will affect
              the percentage of the overhead column. See --percentage for
              more info.

          --symbols
              Only consider these symbols. This option will affect the
              percentage of the overhead column. See --percentage for more
              info.

          -M, --disassembler-style=
              Set disassembler style for objdump.

          --prefix=PREFIX, --prefix-strip=N
              Remove first N entries from source file path names in
              executables and add PREFIX. This allows to display source
              code compiled on systems with different file system layout.

          --source
              Interleave source code with assembly code. Enabled by
              default, disable with --no-source.

          --asm-raw
              Show raw instruction encoding of assembly instructions.

          -g
              Enables call-graph (stack chain/backtrace) recording.

          --call-graph [mode,type,min[,limit],order[,key][,branch]]
              Setup and enable call-graph (stack chain/backtrace)
              recording, implies -g. See --call-graph section in
              perf-record and perf-report man pages for details.

          --children
              Accumulate callchain of children to parent entry so that then
              can show up in the output. The output will have a new
              "Children" column and will be sorted on the data. It requires
              -g/--call-graph option enabled. See the ‘overhead
              calculation’ section for more details. Enabled by default,
              disable with --no-children.

          --max-stack
              Set the stack depth limit when parsing the callchain,
              anything beyond the specified depth will be ignored. This is
              a trade-off between information loss and faster processing
              especially for workloads that can have a very long callchain
              stack.

                  Default: /proc/sys/kernel/perf_event_max_stack when present, 127 otherwise.

          --ignore-callees=<regex>
              Ignore callees of the function(s) matching the given regex.
              This has the effect of collecting the callers of each such
              function into one place in the call-graph tree.

          --percent-limit
              Do not show entries which have an overhead under that
              percent. (Default: 0).

          --percentage
              Determine how to display the overhead percentage of filtered
              entries. Filters can be applied by --comms, --dsos and/or
              --symbols options and Zoom operations on the TUI (thread,
              dso, etc).

                  "relative" means it's relative to filtered entries only so that the
                  sum of shown entries will be always 100%. "absolute" means it retains
                  the original value before and after the filter is applied.

          -w, --column-widths=<width[,width...]>
              Force each column width to the provided list, for large
              terminal readability. 0 means no limit (default behavior).

          --proc-map-timeout
              When processing pre-existing threads /proc/XXX/mmap, it may
              take a long time, because the file may be huge. A time out is
              needed in such cases. This option sets the time out limit.
              The default value is 500 ms.

          -b, --branch-any
              Enable taken branch stack sampling. Any type of taken branch
              may be sampled. This is a shortcut for --branch-filter any.
              See --branch-filter for more infos.

          -j, --branch-filter
              Enable taken branch stack sampling. Each sample captures a
              series of consecutive taken branches. The number of branches
              captured with each sample depends on the underlying hardware,
              the type of branches of interest, and the executed code. It
              is possible to select the types of branches captured by
              enabling filters. For a full list of modifiers please see the
              perf record manpage.

                  The option requires at least one branch type among any, any_call, any_ret, ind_call, cond.
                  The privilege levels may be omitted, in which case, the privilege levels of the associated
                  event are applied to the branch filter. Both kernel (k) and hypervisor (hv) privilege
                  levels are subject to permissions.  When sampling on multiple events, branch stack sampling
                  is enabled for all the sampling events. The sampled branch type is the same for all events.
                  The various filters must be specified as a comma separated list: --branch-filter any_ret,u,k
                  Note that this feature may not be available on all processors.

          --raw-trace
              When displaying traceevent output, do not use print fmt or
              plugins.

          --hierarchy
              Enable hierarchy output.

          --overwrite
              Enable this to use just the most recent records, which helps
              in high core count machines such as Knights Landing/Mill, but
              right now is disabled by default as the pausing used in this
              technique is leading to loss of metadata events such as
              PERF_RECORD_MMAP which makes perf top unable to resolve
              samples, leading to lots of unknown samples appearing on the
              UI. Enable this if you are in such machines and profiling a
              workload that doesn’t creates short lived threads and/or
              doesn’t uses many executable mmap operations. Work is being
              planed to solve this situation, till then, this will remain
              disabled by default.

          --force
              Don’t do ownership validation.

          --num-thread-synthesize
              The number of threads to run when synthesizing events for
              existing processes. By default, the number of threads equals
              to the number of online CPUs.

          --namespaces
              Record events of type PERF_RECORD_NAMESPACES and display it
              with the cgroup_id sort key.

          -G name, --cgroup name
              monitor only in the container (cgroup) called "name". This
              option is available only in per-cpu mode. The cgroup
              filesystem must be mounted. All threads belonging to
              container "name" are monitored when they run on the monitored
              CPUs. Multiple cgroups can be provided. Each cgroup is
              applied to the corresponding event, i.e., first cgroup to
              first event, second cgroup to second event and so on. It is
              possible to provide an empty cgroup (monitor all the time)
              using, e.g., -G foo,,bar. Cgroups must have corresponding
              events, i.e., they always refer to events defined earlier on
              the command line. If the user wants to track multiple events
              for a specific cgroup, the user can use -e e1 -e e2 -G
              foo,foo or just use -e e1 -e e2 -G foo.

          --all-cgroups
              Record events of type PERF_RECORD_CGROUP and display it with
              the cgroup sort key.

          --switch-on EVENT_NAME
              Only consider events after this event is found.

                  E.g.:

                  Find out where broadcast packets are handled

                  perf probe -L icmp_rcv

                  Insert a probe there:

                  perf probe icmp_rcv:59

                  Start perf top and ask it to only consider the cycles events when a
                  broadcast packet arrives This will show a menu with two entries and
                  will start counting when a broadcast packet arrives:

                  perf top -e cycles,probe:icmp_rcv --switch-on=probe:icmp_rcv

                  Alternatively one can ask for --group and then two overhead columns
                  will appear, the first for cycles and the second for the switch-on event.

                  perf top --group -e cycles,probe:icmp_rcv --switch-on=probe:icmp_rcv

                  This may be interesting to measure a workload only after some initialization
                  phase is over, i.e. insert a perf probe at that point and use the above
                  examples replacing probe:icmp_rcv with the just-after-init probe.

          --switch-off EVENT_NAME
              Stop considering events after this event is found.

          --show-on-off-events
              Show the --switch-on/off events too. This has no effect in
              perf top now but probably we’ll make the default not to show
              the switch-on/off events on the --group mode and if there is
              only one event besides the off/on ones, go straight to the
              histogram browser, just like perf top with no events
              explicitly specified does.

          --stitch-lbr
              Show callgraph with stitched LBRs, which may have more
              complete callgraph. The option must be used with --call-graph
              lbr recording. Disabled by default. In common cases with call
              stack overflows, it can recreate better call stacks than the
              default lbr call stack output. But this approach is not full
              proof. There can be cases where it creates incorrect call
              stacks from incorrect matches. The known limitations include
              exception handing such as setjmp/longjmp will have
              calls/returns not match.

::

          The overhead can be shown in two columns as Children and Self
          when perf collects callchains. The self overhead is simply
          calculated by adding all period values of the entry - usually a
          function (symbol). This is the value that perf shows
          traditionally and sum of all the self overhead values should be
          100%.

          The children overhead is calculated by adding all period values
          of the child functions so that it can show the total overhead of
          the higher level functions even if they don’t directly execute
          much. Children here means functions that are called from another
          (parent) function.

          It might be confusing that the sum of all the children overhead
          values exceeds 100% since each of them is already an accumulation
          of self overhead of its child functions. But with this enabled,
          users can find which function has the most overhead even if
          samples are spread over the children.

          Consider the following example; there are three functions like
          below.

              .ft C
              void foo(void) {
                  /* do something */
              }

              void bar(void) {
                  /* do something */
                  foo();
              }

              int main(void) {
                  bar()
                  return 0;
              }
              .ft

          In this case foo is a child of bar, and bar is an immediate child
          of main so foo also is a child of main. In other words, main is a
          parent of foo and bar, and bar is a parent of foo.

          Suppose all samples are recorded in foo and bar only. When it’s
          recorded with callchains the output will show something like
          below in the usual (self-overhead-only) output of perf report:

              .ft C
              Overhead  Symbol
              ........  .....................
                60.00%  foo
                        |
                        --- foo
                            bar
                            main
                            __libc_start_main

                40.00%  bar
                        |
                        --- bar
                            main
                            __libc_start_main
              .ft

          When the --children option is enabled, the self overhead values
          of child functions (i.e. foo and bar) are added to the parents to
          calculate the children overhead. In this case the report could be
          displayed as:

              .ft C
              Children      Self  Symbol
              ........  ........  ....................
               100.00%     0.00%  __libc_start_main
                        |
                        --- __libc_start_main

               100.00%     0.00%  main
                        |
                        --- main
                            __libc_start_main

               100.00%    40.00%  bar
                        |
                        --- bar
                            main
                            __libc_start_main

                60.00%    60.00%  foo
                        |
                        --- foo
                            bar
                            main
                            __libc_start_main
              .ft

          In the above output, the self overhead of foo (60%) was add to
          the children overhead of bar, main and __libc_start_main.
          Likewise, the self overhead of bar (40%) was added to the
          children overhead of main and \_\_libc_start_main.

          So \_\_libc_start_main and main are shown first since they have
          same (100%) children overhead (even though they have zero self
          overhead) and they are the parents of foo and bar.

          Since v3.16 the children overhead is shown by default and the
          output is sorted by its values. The children overhead is disabled
          by specifying --no-children option on the command line or by
          adding report.children = false or top.children = false in the
          perf config file.
