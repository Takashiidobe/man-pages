   TRACE-CMD-SET(1)                                        TRACE-CMD-SET(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          trace-cmd-set - set a configuration parameter of the Ftrace Linux
          internal tracer


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          trace-cmd set [OPTIONS] [command]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The trace-cmd(1) set command will set a configuration parameter
          of the Ftrace Linux kernel tracer. The specified command will be
          run after the ftrace state is set. The configured ftrace state
          can be restored to default using the trace-cmd-reset(1) command.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -p tracer
              Specify a tracer. Tracers usually do more than just trace an
              event. Common tracers are: function, function_graph,
              preemptirqsoff, irqsoff, preemptoff and wakeup. A tracer must
              be supported by the running kernel. To see a list of
              available tracers, see trace-cmd-list(1).

          -e event
              Specify an event to trace. Various static trace points have
              been added to the Linux kernel. They are grouped by subsystem
              where you can enable all events of a given subsystem or
              specify specific events to be enabled. The event is of the
              format "subsystem:event-name". You can also just specify the
              subsystem without the :event-name or the event-name without
              the "subsystem:". Using "-e sched_switch" will enable the
              "sched_switch" event where as, "-e sched" will enable all
              events under the "sched" subsystem.

                  The 'event' can also contain glob expressions. That is, "*stat*" will
                  select all events (or subsystems) that have the characters "stat" in their
                  names.

                  The keyword 'all' can be used to enable all events.

          -T
              Enable a stacktrace on each event. For example:

                            <idle>-0     [003] 58549.289091: sched_switch:         kworker/0:1:0 [120] R ==> trace-cmd:2603 [120]
                            <idle>-0     [003] 58549.289092: kernel_stack:         <stack trace>
                  => schedule (ffffffff814b260e)
                  => cpu_idle (ffffffff8100a38c)
                  => start_secondary (ffffffff814ab828)

          --func-stack
              Enable a stack trace on all functions. Note this is only
              applicable for the "function" plugin tracer, and will only
              take effect if the -l option is used and succeeds in limiting
              functions. If the function tracer is not filtered, and the
              stack trace is enabled, you can live lock the machine.

          -f filter
              Specify a filter for the previous event. This must come after
              a -e. This will filter what events get recorded based on the
              content of the event. Filtering is passed to the kernel
              directly so what filtering is allowed may depend on what
              version of the kernel you have. Basically, it will let you
              use C notation to check if an event should be processed or
              not.

                  ==, >=, <=, >, <, &, |, && and ||

              The above are usually safe to use to compare fields.

          -R trigger
              Specify a trigger for the previous event. This must come
              after a -e. This will add a given trigger to the given event.
              To only enable the trigger and not the event itself, then
              place the event after the -v option.

                  See Documentation/trace/events.txt in the Linux kernel source for more
                  information on triggers.

          -v
              This will negate options specified after it on the command
              line. It affects:

                   -e: Causes all specified events to not be traced. This is useful for
                         selecting a subsystem to be traced but to leave out various events.
                         For example: "-e sched -v -e "*stat*"" will enable all events in
                         the sched subsystem except those that have "stat" in their names.
                   -B: Deletes the specified ftrace instance. There must be no
                         configuration options related to this instance in the command line.
                         For example: "-v -B bar -B foo" will delete instance bar and create
                         a new instance foo.
                  Note: the -v option was taken from the way grep(1) inverts the following
                  matches.

          -P pid
              This will filter only the specified process IDs. Using -P
              will let you trace only events that are caused by the
              process.

          -c
              Used -P to trace the process' children too (if kernel
              supports it).

          --user
              Execute the specified command as given user.

          -C clock
              Set the trace clock to "clock".

                  Use trace-cmd(1) list -C to see what clocks are available.

          -l function-name
              This will limit the function and function_graph tracers to
              only trace the given function name. More than one -l may be
              specified on the command line to trace more than one
              function. The limited use of glob expressions are also
              allowed. These are match* to only filter functions that start
              with match.  *match to only filter functions that end with
              match.  *match\* to only filter on functions that contain
              match.

          -g function-name
              This option is for the function_graph plugin. It will graph
              the given function. That is, it will only trace the function
              and all functions that it calls. You can have more than one
              -g on the command line.

          -n function-name
              This has the opposite effect of -l. The function given with
              the -n option will not be traced. This takes precedence, that
              is, if you include the same function for both -n and -l, it
              will not be traced.

          -d
              Some tracer plugins enable the function tracer by default.
              Like the latency tracers. This option prevents the function
              tracer from being enabled at start up.

          -D
              The option -d will try to use the function-trace option to
              disable the function tracer (if available), otherwise it
              defaults to the proc file: /proc/sys/kernel/ftrace_enabled,
              but will not touch it if the function-trace option is
              available. The -D option will disable both the ftrace_enabled
              proc file as well as the function-trace option if it exists.

                  Note, this disable function tracing for all users, which includes users
                  outside of ftrace tracers (stack_tracer, perf, etc).

          -O option
              Ftrace has various options that can be enabled or disabled.
              This allows you to set them. Appending the text no to an
              option disables it. For example: "-O nograph-time" will
              disable the "graph-time" Ftrace option.

          -b size
              This sets the ring buffer size to size kilobytes. Because the
              Ftrace ring buffer is per CPU, this size is the size of each
              per CPU ring buffer inside the kernel. Using "-b 10000" on a
              machine with 4 CPUs will make Ftrace have a total buffer size
              of 40 Megs.

          -B buffer-name
              If the kernel supports multiple buffers, this will add a
              buffer with the given name. If the buffer name already
              exists, that buffer is just reset.

                  After a buffer name is stated, all events added after that will be
                  associated with that buffer. If no buffer is specified, or an event
                  is specified before a buffer name, it will be associated with the
                  main (toplevel) buffer.

                  trace-cmd set -e sched -B block -e block -B time -e timer sleep 1

                  The above is will enable all sched events in the main buffer. It will
                  then create a 'block' buffer instance and enable all block events within
                  that buffer. A 'time' buffer instance is created and all timer events
                  will be enabled for that event.

          -m size
              The max size in kilobytes that a per cpu buffer should be.
              Note, due to rounding to page size, the number may not be
              totally correct. Also, this is performed by switching between
              two buffers that are half the given size thus the output may
              not be of the given size even if much more was written.

                  Use this to prevent running out of diskspace for long runs.

          -M cpumask
              Set the cpumask for to trace. It only affects the last buffer
              instance given. If supplied before any buffer instance, then
              it affects the main buffer. The value supplied must be a hex
              number.

                  trace-cmd set -p function -M c -B events13 -e all -M 5

                  If the -M is left out, then the mask stays the same. To enable all
                  CPUs, pass in a value of '-1'.

          -i
              By default, if an event is listed that trace-cmd does not
              find, it will exit with an error. This option will just
              ignore events that are listed on the command line but are not
              found on the system.

          -q | --quiet
              Suppresses normal output, except for errors.

          --max-graph-depth depth
              Set the maximum depth the function_graph tracer will trace
              into a function. A value of one will only show where
              userspace enters the kernel but not any functions called in
              the kernel. The default is zero, which means no limit.

          --cmdlines-size size
              Set the number of entries the kernel tracing file
              "saved_cmdlines" can contain. This file is a circular buffer
              which stores the mapping between cmdlines and PIDs. If full,
              it leads to unresolved cmdlines ("<...>") within the trace.
              The kernel default value is 128.

          --module module
              Filter a module’s name in function tracing. It is equivalent
              to adding :mod:module after all other functions being
              filtered. If no other function filter is listed, then all
              modules functions will be filtered in the filter.

                  '--module snd'  is equivalent to  '-l :mod:snd'

                  '--module snd -l "*jack*"' is equivalent to '-l "*jack*:mod:snd"'

                  '--module snd -n "*"' is equivalent to '-n :mod:snd'

          --stderr
              Have output go to stderr instead of stdout, but the output of
              the command executed will not be changed. This is useful if
              you want to monitor the output of the command being executed,
              but not see the output from trace-cmd.

          --fork
              If a command is listed, then trace-cmd will wait for that
              command to finish, unless the --fork option is specified.
              Then it will fork the command and return immediately.
