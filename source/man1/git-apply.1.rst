::

          git-apply - Apply a patch to files and/or to the index


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git apply [--stat] [--numstat] [--summary] [--check] [--index | --intent-to-add] [--3way]
                    [--apply] [--no-add] [--build-fake-ancestor=<file>] [-R | --reverse]

                    [--verbose] [--unsafe-paths] [<patch>...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Reads the supplied diff output (i.e. "a patch") and applies it to
          files. When running from a subdirectory in a repository, patched
          paths outside the directory are ignored. With the --index option
          the patch is also applied to the index, and with the --cached
          option the patch is only applied to the index. Without these
          options, the command applies the patch only to files, and does
          not require them to be in a Git repository.

          This command applies the patch but does not create a commit. Use
          git-am(1) to create commits from patches generated by
          git-format-patch(1) and/or received by email.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          <patch>...
              The files to read the patch from.  - can be used to read from
              the standard input.

          --stat
              Instead of applying the patch, output diffstat for the input.
              Turns off "apply".

          --numstat
              Similar to --stat, but shows the number of added and deleted
              lines in decimal notation and the pathname without
              abbreviation, to make it more machine friendly. For binary
              files, outputs two - instead of saying 0 0. Turns off
              "apply".

          --summary
              Instead of applying the patch, output a condensed summary of
              information obtained from git diff extended headers, such as
              creations, renames and mode changes. Turns off "apply".

          --check
              Instead of applying the patch, see if the patch is applicable
              to the current working tree and/or the index file and detects
              errors. Turns off "apply".

          --index
              Apply the patch to both the index and the working tree (or
              merely check that it would apply cleanly to both if --check
              is in effect). Note that --index expects index entries and
              working tree copies for relevant paths to be identical (their
              contents and metadata such as file mode must match), and will
              raise an error if they are not, even if the patch would apply
              cleanly to both the index and the working tree in isolation.

          --cached
              Apply the patch to just the index, without touching the
              working tree. If --check is in effect, merely check that it
              would apply cleanly to the index entry.

          --intent-to-add
              When applying the patch only to the working tree, mark new
              files to be added to the index later (see --intent-to-add
              option in git-add(1)). This option is ignored unless running
              in a Git repository and --index is not specified. Note that
              --index could be implied by other options such as --cached or
              --3way.

          -3, --3way
              Attempt 3-way merge if the patch records the identity of
              blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have those blobs
              available locally, possibly leaving the conflict markers in
              the files in the working tree for the user to resolve. This
              option implies the --index option unless the --cached option
              is used, and is incompatible with the --reject option. When
              used with the --cached option, any conflicts are left at
              higher stages in the cache.

          --build-fake-ancestor=<file>
              Newer git diff output has embedded index information for each
              blob to help identify the original version that the patch
              applies to. When this flag is given, and if the original
              versions of the blobs are available locally, builds a
              temporary index containing those blobs.

              When a pure mode change is encountered (which has no index
              information), the information is read from the current index
              instead.

          -R, --reverse
              Apply the patch in reverse.

          --reject
              For atomicity, git apply by default fails the whole patch and
              does not touch the working tree when some of the hunks do not
              apply. This option makes it apply the parts of the patch that
              are applicable, and leave the rejected hunks in corresponding
              *.rej files.

          -z
              When --numstat has been given, do not munge pathnames, but
              use a NUL-terminated machine-readable format.

              Without this option, pathnames with "unusual" characters are
              quoted as explained for the configuration variable
              core.quotePath (see git-config(1)).

          -p<n>
              Remove <n> leading path components (separated by slashes)
              from traditional diff paths. E.g., with -p2, a patch against
              a/dir/file will be applied directly to file. The default is
              1.

          -C<n>
              Ensure at least <n> lines of surrounding context match before
              and after each change. When fewer lines of surrounding
              context exist they all must match. By default no context is
              ever ignored.

          --unidiff-zero
              By default, git apply expects that the patch being applied is
              a unified diff with at least one line of context. This
              provides good safety measures, but breaks down when applying
              a diff generated with --unified=0. To bypass these checks use
              --unidiff-zero.

              Note, for the reasons stated above usage of context-free
              patches is discouraged.

          --apply
              If you use any of the options marked "Turns off apply" above,
              git apply reads and outputs the requested information without
              actually applying the patch. Give this flag after those flags
              to also apply the patch.

          --no-add
              When applying a patch, ignore additions made by the patch.
              This can be used to extract the common part between two files
              by first running diff on them and applying the result with
              this option, which would apply the deletion part but not the
              addition part.

          --allow-binary-replacement, --binary
              Historically we did not allow binary patch applied without an
              explicit permission from the user, and this flag was the way
              to do so. Currently we always allow binary patch application,
              so this is a no-op.

          --exclude=<path-pattern>
              Don’t apply changes to files matching the given path pattern.
              This can be useful when importing patchsets, where you want
              to exclude certain files or directories.

          --include=<path-pattern>
              Apply changes to files matching the given path pattern. This
              can be useful when importing patchsets, where you want to
              include certain files or directories.

              When --exclude and --include patterns are used, they are
              examined in the order they appear on the command line, and
              the first match determines if a patch to each path is used. A
              patch to a path that does not match any include/exclude
              pattern is used by default if there is no include pattern on
              the command line, and ignored if there is any include
              pattern.

          --ignore-space-change, --ignore-whitespace
              When applying a patch, ignore changes in whitespace in
              context lines if necessary. Context lines will preserve their
              whitespace, and they will not undergo whitespace fixing
              regardless of the value of the --whitespace option. New lines
              will still be fixed, though.

          --whitespace=<action>
              When applying a patch, detect a new or modified line that has
              whitespace errors. What are considered whitespace errors is
              controlled by core.whitespace configuration. By default,
              trailing whitespaces (including lines that solely consist of
              whitespaces) and a space character that is immediately
              followed by a tab character inside the initial indent of the
              line are considered whitespace errors.

              By default, the command outputs warning messages but applies
              the patch. When git-apply is used for statistics and not
              applying a patch, it defaults to nowarn.

              You can use different <action> values to control this
              behavior:

              •   nowarn turns off the trailing whitespace warning.

              •   warn outputs warnings for a few such errors, but applies
                  the patch as-is (default).

              •   fix outputs warnings for a few such errors, and applies
                  the patch after fixing them (strip is a synonym --- the
                  tool used to consider only trailing whitespace characters
                  as errors, and the fix involved stripping them, but
                  modern Gits do more).

              •   error outputs warnings for a few such errors, and refuses
                  to apply the patch.

              •   error-all is similar to error but shows all errors.

          --inaccurate-eof
              Under certain circumstances, some versions of diff do not
              correctly detect a missing new-line at the end of the file.
              As a result, patches created by such diff programs do not
              record incomplete lines correctly. This option adds support
              for applying such patches by working around this bug.

          -v, --verbose
              Report progress to stderr. By default, only a message about
              the current patch being applied will be printed. This option
              will cause additional information to be reported.

          --recount
              Do not trust the line counts in the hunk headers, but infer
              them by inspecting the patch (e.g. after editing the patch
              without adjusting the hunk headers appropriately).

          --directory=<root>
              Prepend <root> to all filenames. If a "-p" argument was also
              passed, it is applied before prepending the new root.

              For example, a patch that talks about updating a/git-gui.sh
              to b/git-gui.sh can be applied to the file in the working
              tree modules/git-gui/git-gui.sh by running git apply
              --directory=modules/git-gui.

          --unsafe-paths
              By default, a patch that affects outside the working area
              (either a Git controlled working tree, or the current working
              directory when "git apply" is used as a replacement of GNU
              patch) is rejected as a mistake (or a mischief).

              When git apply is used as a "better GNU patch", the user can
              pass the --unsafe-paths option to override this safety check.
              This option has no effect when --index or --cached is in use.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          apply.ignoreWhitespace
              Set to change if you want changes in whitespace to be ignored
              by default. Set to one of: no, none, never, false if you want
              changes in whitespace to be significant.

          apply.whitespace
              When no --whitespace flag is given from the command line,
              this configuration item is used as the default.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If the patch contains any changes to submodules then git apply
          treats these changes as follows.

          If --index is specified (explicitly or implicitly), then the
          submodule commits must match the index exactly for the patch to
          apply. If any of the submodules are checked-out, then these
          check-outs are completely ignored, i.e., they are not required to
          be up to date or clean and they are not updated.

          If --index is not specified, then the submodule commits in the
          patch are ignored and only the absence or presence of the
          corresponding subdirectory is checked and (if possible) updated.
