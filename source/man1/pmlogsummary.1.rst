   PMLOGSUMMARY(1)          General Commands Manual         PMLOGSUMMARY(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsummary - calculate averages of metrics stored in a set of
          PCP archives


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsummary [-abfFHiIlmMNsvVxyz?]  [-B nbins] [-n pmnsfile] [-p
          precision] [-S starttime] [-T endtime] [-Z timezone] archive
          [metricname ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsummary prints statistical information about metrics of
          numeric type contained within the files of a set of Performance
          Co-Pilot (PCP) archive logs.  The default output prints time
          averages for both counter and non-counter metrics.  The set of
          archive logs is identified by archive, which is a comma-separated
          list of names, each of which may be the base name of an archive
          or the name of a directory containing one or more archives.  The
          archive logs are typically created using pmlogger(1).

          The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.
          If metricname is a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name
          Space (PMNS(5)), then pmlogsummary will recursively descend the
          PMNS and report on all leaf nodes.  If no metricname argument is
          given, the root of the namespace is used.

          Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before
          being evaluated.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -a, --all
               Print all information.  This is equivalent to -blmMy.

          -b   Print both forms of averaging, that is both stochastic and
               time averaging.

          -B nbins, --bins=nbins
               Print the approximate distribution of values, using
               histogram bins such that the value range (minimum - maximum)
               for each metric is divided equally into nbins bins, and each
               bin accumulates the frequency of observed values in the
               corresponding range.  Refer to the ``OUTPUT FORMAT'' section
               below for a description of how the distribution of values is
               reported).

          -f   Spreadsheet format - the tab character is used to delimit
               each field printed.  This option is intended to allow
               pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into common
               spreadsheet applications.

          -F   Spreadsheet format - the comma character is used to delimit
               each field printed.  This option is intended to allow
               pmlogsummary output to be imported directly into common
               spreadsheet applications which support the Comma Separated
               Value (.csv) format.

          -H, --header
               Print a one-line header at the start showing what each field
               represents.

          -i, --mintime
               Also print the time at which the minimum value was logged.
               The format of this timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT
               FORMAT'' section below.

          -I, --maxtime
               Also print the time at which the maximum value was logged.
               The format of this timestamp is described in the ``OUTPUT
               FORMAT'' section below.

          -l, --label
               Also print the archive label, showing the log format
               version, the time and date for the start and end of the
               archive time window, and the host from which the performance
               metrics values were collected.

          -m, --minimum
               Also print the minimum logged value for each metric.

          -M, --maximum
               Also print the maximum logged value for each metric.

          -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
               Load an alternative Performance Metrics Name Space (PMNS(5))
               from the file pmnsfile.

          -N   Suppress any warnings resulting from individual archive
               fetches (default).

          -p precision, --precision=precision
               Print all floating point numbers with precision digits after
               the decimal place.

          -s, --sum
               Print (only) the sum of all logged values for each metric.

          -S starttime, --start=starttime
               Set the starttime of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1)
               for a complete description of the syntax for starttime.

          -T endtime, --finish=endtime
               Set the endtime of the time window.  Refer to PCPIntro(1)
               for a complete description of the syntax for endtime.

          -v, --verbose
               Report (verbosely) on warnings resulting from individual
               archive fetches.

          -V, --version
               Display version number and exit.

          -x   Print stochastic averages instead of the default (time
               averages).

          -y, --samples
               Also print the number of samples encountered in the set of
               archives for each metric.

          -z, --hostzone
               Change the timezone to the local timezone at the host that
               is the source of the performance metrics, as specified in
               the label record of the archive log.

          -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
               By default, pmlogsummary reports the time of day according
               to the local timezone on the system where pmlogsummary is
               run.  Change the timezone to timezone in the format of the
               environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The pmlogsummary output format is spartan as it is intended to be
          post-processed with standard tools.  This means that there is no
          annotation associated with each output field which would make
          processing harder.  The intention is that pmlogsummary output be
          massaged into a format which can be used by a spreadsheet
          program, is suitable for inclusion in a web page, or whatever.

          For each metric, pmlogsummary produces a single output line as
          follows:

             metricname  value(s) units

          For metrics with multiple instances, pmlogsummary produces
          multiple lines of output as follows:

             metricname ["instance 1"] value(s) units
             metricname ["instance 2"] value(s) units
             metricname ["instance N"] value(s) units

          The printed value(s) for each metric always follow this order:
          stochastic average, time average, minimum, minimum timestamp,
          maximum, maximum timestamp, count, [bin 1 range], bin 1 count,
          ... [bin nbins range], bin nbins count.  The individual values
          for each metric are space-separated (unless the -f option is
          used).

          All counter metrics which are measured in units of time will be
          converted to seconds before being rate converted and used in the
          pmlogsummary calculations.  The values calculated for these
          metrics are also printed in seconds.

          The units will be displayed in the format described by
          pmUnitsStr(3).

          Given either of the -i or -I options, pmlogsummary produces two
          different timestamp formats, depending on the interval over which
          it is run.  For an interval greater than 24 hours, the date is
          displayed in addition to the time at which the maxima and/or
          minima occurred.  If the extent of the data being checked is less
          than 24 hours, a more precise format is used (time is displayed
          with millisecond precision, but without the date).


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The average for an individual metric is calculated as follows:

          Non-counter metrics are averaged using stochastic averaging -
          each observation has an equal weighting towards the calculation
          of the average (the sum of all values divided by the total number
          of values, for each metric).

          Counter metrics are averaged using time averaging (by default),
          but the -x option can be used to specify that counters be
          averaged using the stochastic method instead.  When calculating a
          time average, the sum of the product of each sample value
          multiplied by the time difference between each sample, is divided
          by the total time over which that metric was logged.

          Counter metrics whose measurements do not span 90% of the set of
          archives will be printed with the metric name prefixed by an
          asterisk (*).
