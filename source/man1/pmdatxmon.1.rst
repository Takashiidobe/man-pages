   PMDATXMON(1)             General Commands Manual            PMDATXMON(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdatxmon, txrecord, genload - txmon performance metrics domain
          agent (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/pmdatxmon [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
          username] tx_type ...
          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/txrecord [-l]
          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/txrecord tx_type servtime [tx_type servtime
          ... ]
          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/genload


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdatxmon is an example Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA)
          which exports a small number of performance metrics from a
          simulated transaction monitor.

          The txmon PMDA is shipped as both binary and source code and is
          designed to be an aid for PMDA developers; the txmon PMDA
          demonstrates how performance data can be exported from an
          application (in this case txrecord) to the PCP infrastructure via
          a shared memory segment.  As a matter of convenience, pmdatxmon
          creates (and destroys on exit) the shared memory segment.

          The tx_type arguments are arbitrary unique tags used to identify
          different transaction types.

          The txrecord application simulates the processing of one or more
          transactions identified by tx_type and with an observed service
          time of servtime .

          With the -l option, txrecord displays the current summary of the
          transaction activity from the shared memory segment.

          genload is a shell and awk(1) script that acts as a front-end to
          txrecord to generate a constant load of simulated transaction
          activity.

          A brief description of the pmdatxmon command line options
          follows:

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               txmon.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
               when pmdatxmon is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
               log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
               written to the standard error instead.

          -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
               the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
               but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
               used by default.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
          txmon performance metrics, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon
               # ./Install

          You will be prompted for the tx_type tags.

          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon
               # ./Remove

          pmdatxmon is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/help
                 default help text file for the txmon metrics
          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/Install
                 installation script for the pmdatxmon agent
          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/txmon/Remove
                 undo installation script for the pmdatxmon agent
          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/txmon.log
                 default log file for error messages and other information
                 from pmdatxmon


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
