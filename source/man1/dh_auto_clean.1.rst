   DH_AUTO_CLEAN(1)                Debhelper               DH_AUTO_CLEAN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_clean - automatically cleans up after a build


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_clean [build system options] [debhelper options]
          [-- params]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_auto_clean is a debhelper program that tries to automatically
          clean up after a package build. It does so by running the
          appropriate command for the build system it detects the package
          uses. For example, if there's a Makefile and it contains a
          distclean, realclean, or clean target, then this is done by
          running make (or MAKE, if the environment variable is set). If
          there is a setup.py or Build.PL, it is run to clean the package.

          This is intended to work for about 90% of packages. If it doesn't
          work, or tries to use the wrong clean target, you're encouraged
          to skip using dh_auto_clean at all, and just run make clean
          manually.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          See "BUILD SYSTEM OPTIONS" in debhelper(7) for a list of common
          build system selection and control options.

          -- params
              Pass params to the program that is run, after the parameters
              that dh_auto_clean usually passes.
