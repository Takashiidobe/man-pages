   AUTOFSD-PROBE(1)         General Commands Manual        AUTOFSD-PROBE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          autofsd-probe - probe AutoFS mount/unmount daemon


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_BINADM_DIR/autofsd-probe [-h host] [-t timeout]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          autofsd-probe will check the status of the autofsd(1) daemon on
          the specified host.

          Unless directed to another host by the -h option, autofsd-probe
          will contact the AutoFS daemon on the local host.

          The AutoFS file system is built on the Remote Procedure Call
          (RPC(3)) library routines.  The -t option allows the total
          timeout and retry timeout intervals to be set for all remote
          procedure call operations used with autofsd-probe.  This option
          accepts an interval argument in the form described in the
          PCPIntro(1) manual page.

          autofsd-probe is typically used in an automated fashion from
          within pmdashping(1) and in conjunction with pmie(1), for
          monitoring response time and service failure.

          By default autofsd-probe will not produce any output, unless
          there is an error in which case a diagnostic message will be
          displayed and the exit status will indicate the reason for
          failure.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If autofsd-probe succeeds, then 0 will be returned.  If the
          attempt to establish a connection with autofsd fails, then 2 is
          returned.  If the subsequent attempt to invoke an autofsd
          response fails, then 1 will be returned.

          In the case of a syntactical command line error, 4 is returned
          and the usage message is displayed.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
