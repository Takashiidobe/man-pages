   BLKPARSE(1)                                                  BLKPARSE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          blkparse - produce formatted output of event streams of block
          devices


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          blkparse [ options ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The blkparse utility will attempt to combine streams of events
          for various devices on various CPUs, and produce a formatted
          output of the event information.  Specifically, it will take the
          (machine-readable) output of the blktrace utility and convert it
          to a nicely formatted and human-readable form.

          As with blktrace, some details concerning blkparse will help in
          understanding the command line options presented below.

          - By default, blkparse expects to run in a post-processing mode;
            one where the trace events have been saved by a previous run of
            blktrace, and blkparse is combining event streams and dumping
            formatted data.

            blkparse may be run in a live manner concurrently with blktrace
            by specifying -i - to blkparse, and combining it with the live
            option for blktrace.  An example would be:

               % blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -

          - You can set how many blkparse batches event reads via the -b
            option, the default is to handle events in batches of 512.

          - If you have saved event traces in blktrace with different
            output names (via the -o option to blktrace), you must specify
            the same input name via the -i option.

          - The format of the output data can be controlled via the -f or
            -F options -- see OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING for
            details.

          By default, blkparse sends formatted data to standard output.
          This may be changed via the -o option, or text output can be
          disabled via the -O option. A merged binary stream can be
          produced using the -d option.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -A hex-mask
          --set-mask=hex-mask
                 Set filter mask to hex-mask, see blktrace (8) for masks

          -a mask
          --act-mask=mask
                 Add mask to current filter, see blktrace (8) for masks

          -D dir
          --input-directory=dir
                 Prepend dir to input file names

          -b batch
          --batch={batch}
                 Standard input read batching

          -i file
          --input=file
                 Specifies base name for input files -- default is
                 device.blktrace.cpu.

                 As noted above, specifying -i - runs in live mode with
                 blktrace (reading data from standard in).

          -F typ,fmt
          --format=typ,fmt
          -f fmt
          --format-spec=fmt
                 Sets output format (See OUTPUT DESCRIPTION AND FORMATTING
                 for details.)

                 The -f form specifies a format for all events

                 The -F form allows one to specify a format for a specific
                 event type. The single-character typ field is one of the
                 action specifiers described in ACTION IDENTIFIERS.

          -M
          --no-msgs
                 When -d is specified, this will stop messages from being
                 output to the file. (Can seriously reduce the size of the
                 resultant file when using the CFQ I/O scheduler.)

          -h
          --hash-by-name
                 Hash processes by name, not by PID

          -o file
          --output=file
                 Output file

          -O
          --no-text-output
                 Do not produce text output, used for binary (-d) only

          -d file
          --dump-binary=file
                 Binary output file

          -q
          --quiet
                 Quiet mode

          -s
          --per-program-stats
                 Displays data sorted by program

          -S event
          --sort-program-stats=event
                 Displays each program's data sorted by program name or io
                 event, like Queued, Read, Write and Complete. When -S is
                 specified the -s will be ignored.  The capital letters
                 Q,R,W,C stand for KB, then q/r/w/c stand for IO.

                 If you want to soct programs by how many data they queued,
                 you can use:

                 blkparse -i sda.blktrace. -q -S Q -o sda.parse

          -t
          --track-ios
                 Display time deltas per IO

          -w span
          --stopwatch=span
                 Display traces for the span specified -- where span can
                 be:
                 end-time -- Display traces from time 0 through end-time
                 (in ns)
                 or
                 start:end-time -- Display traces from time start through
                 end-time (in ns).

          -v
          --verbose
                 More verbose marginal on marginal errors

          -V
          --version
                 Display version


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following trace actions are recognised:

          C -- complete A previously issued request has been completed.
              The output will detail the sector and size of that request,
              as well as the success or failure of it.

          D -- issued A request that previously resided on the block layer
              queue or in the i/o scheduler has been sent to the driver.

          I -- inserted A request is being sent to the i/o scheduler for
              addition to the internal queue and later service by the
              driver. The request is fully formed at this time.

          Q -- queued This notes intent to queue i/o at the given location.
              No real requests exists yet.

          B -- bounced The data pages attached to this bio are not
              reachable by the hardware and must be bounced to a lower
              memory location. This causes a big slowdown in i/o
              performance, since the data must be copied to/from kernel
              buffers. Usually this can be fixed with using better hardware
              -- either a better i/o controller, or a platform with an
              IOMMU.

          M -- back merge A previously inserted request exists that ends on
              the boundary of where this i/o begins, so the i/o scheduler
              can merge them together.

          F -- front merge Same as the back merge, except this i/o ends
              where a previously inserted requests starts.

          M -- front or back merge One of the above.

          G -- get request To send any type of request to a block device, a
              struct request container must be allocated first.

          S -- sleep No available request structures were available, so the
              issuer has to wait for one to be freed.

          P -- plug When i/o is queued to a previously empty block device
              queue, Linux will plug the queue in anticipation of future
              ios being added before this data is needed.

          U -- unplug Some request data already queued in the device, start
              sending requests to the driver. This may happen automatically
              if a timeout period has passed (see next entry) or if a
              number of requests have been added to the queue.

          T -- unplug due to timer If nobody requests the i/o that was
              queued after plugging the queue, Linux will automatically
              unplug it after a defined period has passed.

          X -- split On raid or device mapper setups, an incoming i/o may
              straddle a device or internal zone and needs to be chopped up
              into smaller pieces for service. This may indicate a
              performance problem due to a bad setup of that raid/dm
              device, but may also just be part of normal boundary
              conditions. dm is notably bad at this and will clone lots of
              i/o.

          A -- remap For stacked devices, incoming i/o is remapped to
              device below it in the i/o stack. The remap action details
              what exactly is being remapped to what.

          R -- requeue Put a request back on queue.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The output from blkparse can be tailored for specific use -- in
          particular, to ease parsing of output, and/or limit output fields
          to those the user wants to see. The data for fields which can be
          output include:

          a   Action, a (small) string (1 or 2 characters) -- see table
              below for more details

          c   CPU id

          C   Command

          d   RWBS field, a (small) string (1-3 characters)  -- see section
              below for more details

          D   7-character string containing the major and minor numbers of
              the event's device (separated by a comma).

          e   Error value

          g   Cgroup identifier of the cgroup that generated the IO. Note
              that this requires appropriate kernel support (kernel version
              at least 4.14).

          m   Minor number of event's device.

          M   Major number of event's device.

          n   Number of blocks

          N   Number of bytes

          p   Process ID

          P   Display packet data -- series of hexadecimal values

          s   Sequence numbers

          S   Sector number

          t   Time stamp (nanoseconds)

          T   Time stamp (seconds)

          u   Elapsed value in microseconds (-t command line option)

          U   Payload unsigned integer

          z   The absolute time, as local time in your time zone, with no
              date displayed

          Note that the user can optionally specify field display width,
          and optionally a left-aligned specifier. These precede field
          specifiers, with a '%' character, followed by the optional left-
          alignment specifier (-) followed by the width (a decimal number)
          and then the field.

          Thus, to specify the command in a 12-character field that is left
          aligned:

              -f "%-12C"


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

          The following table shows the various actions which may be
          output:

          A      IO was remapped to a different device

          B      IO bounced

          C      IO completion

          D      IO issued to driver

          F      IO front merged with request on queue

          G      Get request

          I      IO inserted onto request queue

          M      IO back merged with request on queue

          P      Plug request

          Q      IO handled by request queue code

          S      Sleep request

          T      Unplug due to timeout

          U      Unplug request

          X      Split


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This is a small string containing at least one character ('R' for
          read, 'W' for write, or 'D' for block discard operation), and
          optionally either a 'B' (for barrier operations) or 'S' (for
          synchronous operations).


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard header (or initial fields displayed) include:

              "%D %2c %8s %5T.%9t %5p %2a %3d"

          Breaking this down:

          %D     Displays the event's device major/minor as: %3d,%-3d.

          %2c    CPU ID (2-character field).

          %8s    Sequence number

          %5T.%9t
                 5-character field for the seconds portion of the time
                 stamp and a 9-character field for the nanoseconds in the
                 time stamp.

          %5p    5-character field for the process ID.

          %2a    2-character field for one of the actions.

          %3d    3-character field for the RWBS data.

                 Seeing this in action:

                     8,0    3        1     0.000000000   697  G   W 223490
                 + 8 [kjournald]

                 The header is the data in this line up to the 223490
                 (starting block).  The default output for all event types
                 includes this header.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          C -- complete
              If a payload is present, this is presented between
              parenthesis following the header, followed by the error
              value.

              If no payload is present, the sector and number of blocks are
              presented (with an intervening plus (+) character). If the -t
              option was specified, then the elapsed time is presented. In
              either case, it is followed by the error value for the
              completion.

          B -- bounced
          D -- issued
          I -- inserted
          Q -- queued
              If a payload is present, the number of payload bytes is
              output, followed by the payload in hexadecimal between
              parenthesis.

              If no payload is present, the sector and number of blocks are
              presented (with an intervening plus (+) character). If the -t
              option was specified, then the elapsed time is presented (in
              parenthesis). In either case, it is followed by the command
              associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

          F -- front merge
          G -- get request
          M -- back merge
          S -- sleep
              The starting sector and number of blocks is output (with an
              intervening plus (+) character), followed by the command
              associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

          P -- plug
              The command associated with the event (surrounded by square
              brackets) is output.

          U -- unplug
          T -- unplug due to timer
              The command associated with the event (surrounded by square
              brackets) is output, followed by the number of requests
              outstanding.

          X -- split
              The original starting sector followed by the new sector
              (separated by a slash (/) is output, followed by the command
              associated with the event (surrounded by square brackets).

          A -- remap
              Sector and length is output, along with the original device
              and sector offset.

::

          To trace the i/o on the device /dev/sda and parse the output to
          human readable form, use the following command:

              % blktrace -d /dev/sda -o - | blkparse -i -

          (see blktrace (8) for more information).  This same behaviour can
          be achieve with the convenience script btrace.  The command

              % btrace /dev/sda

          has exactly the same effect as the previous command. See btrace
          (8) for more information.

          To trace the i/o on a device and save the output for later
          processing with blkparse, use blktrace like this:

              % blktrace /dev/sda /dev/sdb

          This will trace i/o on the devices /dev/sda and /dev/sdb and save
          the recorded information in the files sda and sdb in the current
          directory, for the two different devices, respectively.  This
          trace information can later be parsed by the blkparse utility:

              % blkparse sda sdb

          which will output the previously recorded tracing information in
          human readable form to stdout.
