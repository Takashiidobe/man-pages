   CHATTR(1)                General Commands Manual               CHATTR(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          chattr - change file attributes on a Linux file system


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          chattr [ -RVf ] [ -v version ] [ -p project ] [ mode ] files...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          chattr changes the file attributes on a Linux file system.

          The format of a symbolic mode is +-=[aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux].

          The operator '+' causes the selected attributes to be added to
          the existing attributes of the files; '-' causes them to be
          removed; and '=' causes them to be the only attributes that the
          files have.

          The letters 'aAcCdDeFijmPsStTux' select the new attributes for
          the files: append only (a), no atime updates (A), compressed (c),
          no copy on write (C), no dump (d), synchronous directory updates
          (D), extent format (e), case-insensitive directory lookups (F),
          immutable (i), data journaling (j), don't compress (m), project
          hierarchy (P), secure deletion (s), synchronous updates (S), no
          tail-merging (t), top of directory hierarchy (T), undeletable
          (u), and direct access for files (x).

          The following attributes are read-only, and may be listed by
          lsattr(1) but not modified by chattr: encrypted (E), indexed
          directory (I), inline data (N), and verity (V).

          Not all flags are supported or utilized by all file systems;
          refer to file system-specific man pages such as btrfs(5),
          ext4(5), and xfs(5) for more file system-specific details.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -R     Recursively change attributes of directories and their
                 contents.

          -V     Be verbose with chattr's output and print the program
                 version.

          -f     Suppress most error messages.

          -v version
                 Set the file's version/generation number.

          -p project
                 Set the file's project number.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          a      A file with the 'a' attribute set can only be opened in
                 append mode for writing.  Only the superuser or a process
                 possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or
                 clear this attribute.

          A      When a file with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its
                 atime record is not modified.  This avoids a certain
                 amount of disk I/O for laptop systems.

          c      A file with the 'c' attribute set is automatically
                 compressed on the disk by the kernel.  A read from this
                 file returns uncompressed data.  A write to this file
                 compresses data before storing them on the disk.  Note:
                 please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section
                 at the end of this document.  (Note: For btrfs, If the 'c'
                 flag is set, then the 'C' flag cannot be set. Also
                 conflicts with btrfs mount option 'nodatasum')

          C      A file with the 'C' attribute set will not be subject to
                 copy-on-write updates.  This flag is only supported on
                 file systems which perform copy-on-write.  (Note: For
                 btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or empty files.
                 If it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it
                 is undefined when the blocks assigned to the file will be
                 fully stable.  If the 'C' flag is set on a directory, it
                 will have no effect on the directory, but new files
                 created in that directory will have the No_COW attribute
                 set. If the 'C' flag is set, then the 'c' flag cannot be
                 set.)

          d      A file with the 'd' attribute set is not a candidate for
                 backup when the dump(8) program is run.

          D      When a directory with the 'D' attribute set is modified,
                 the changes are written synchronously to the disk; this is
                 equivalent to the 'dirsync' mount option applied to a
                 subset of the files.

          e      The 'e' attribute indicates that the file is using extents
                 for mapping the blocks on disk.  It may not be removed
                 using chattr(1).

          E      A file, directory, or symlink with the 'E' attribute set
                 is encrypted by the file system.  This attribute may not
                 be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can be
                 displayed by lsattr(1).

          F      A directory with the 'F' attribute set indicates that all
                 the path lookups inside that directory are made in a case-
                 insensitive fashion.  This attribute can only be changed
                 in empty directories on file systems with the casefold
                 feature enabled.

          i      A file with the 'i' attribute cannot be modified: it
                 cannot be deleted or renamed, no link can be created to
                 this file, most of the file's metadata can not be
                 modified, and the file can not be opened in write mode.
                 Only the superuser or a process possessing the
                 CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this
                 attribute.

          I      The 'I' attribute is used by the htree code to indicate
                 that a directory is being indexed using hashed trees.  It
                 may not be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can
                 be displayed by lsattr(1).

          j      A file with the 'j' attribute has all of its data written
                 to the ext3 or ext4 journal before being written to the
                 file itself, if the file system is mounted with the
                 "data=ordered" or "data=writeback" options and the file
                 system has a journal.  When the file system is mounted
                 with the "data=journal" option all file data is already
                 journalled and this attribute has no effect.  Only the
                 superuser or a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE
                 capability can set or clear this attribute.

          m      A file with the 'm' attribute is excluded from compression
                 on file systems that support per-file compression.

          N      A file with the 'N' attribute set indicates that the file
                 has data stored inline, within the inode itself. It may
                 not be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can be
                 displayed by lsattr(1).

          P      A directory with the 'P' attribute set will enforce a
                 hierarchical structure for project id's.  This means that
                 files and directories created in the directory will
                 inherit the project id of the directory, rename operations
                 are constrained so when a file or directory is moved into
                 another directory, that the project ids must match.  In
                 addition, a hard link to file can only be created when the
                 project id for the file and the destination directory
                 match.

          s      When a file with the 's' attribute set is deleted, its
                 blocks are zeroed and written back to the disk.  Note:
                 please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section
                 at the end of this document.

          S      When a file with the 'S' attribute set is modified, the
                 changes are written synchronously to the disk; this is
                 equivalent to the 'sync' mount option applied to a subset
                 of the files.

          t      A file with the 't' attribute will not have a partial
                 block fragment at the end of the file merged with other
                 files (for those file systems which support tail-merging).
                 This is necessary for applications such as LILO which read
                 the file system directly, and which don't understand tail-
                 merged files.  Note: As of this writing, the ext2, ext3,
                 and ext4 file systems do not support tail-merging.

          T      A directory with the 'T' attribute will be deemed to be
                 the top of directory hierarchies for the purposes of the
                 Orlov block allocator.  This is a hint to the block
                 allocator used by ext3 and ext4 that the subdirectories
                 under this directory are not related, and thus should be
                 spread apart for allocation purposes.   For example it is
                 a very good idea to set the 'T' attribute on the /home
                 directory, so that /home/john and /home/mary are placed
                 into separate block groups.  For directories where this
                 attribute is not set, the Orlov block allocator will try
                 to group subdirectories closer together where possible.

          u      When a file with the 'u' attribute set is deleted, its
                 contents are saved.  This allows the user to ask for its
                 undeletion.  Note: please make sure to read the bugs and
                 limitations section at the end of this document.

          x      The 'x' attribute can be set on a directory or file.  If
                 the attribute is set on an existing directory, it will be
                 inherited by all files and subdirectories that are
                 subsequently created in the directory.  If an existing
                 directory has contained some files and subdirectories,
                 modifying the attribute on the parent directory doesn't
                 change the attributes on these files and subdirectories.

          V      A file with the 'V' attribute set has fs-verity enabled.
                 It cannot be written to, and the file system will
                 automatically verify all data read from it against a
                 cryptographic hash that covers the entire file's contents,
                 e.g. via a Merkle tree.  This makes it possible to
                 efficiently authenticate the file.  This attribute may not
                 be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can be
                 displayed by lsattr(1).

          chattr was written by Remy Card <Remy.Card@linux.org>.  It is
          currently being maintained by Theodore Ts'o <tytso@alum.mit.edu>.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The 'c', 's',  and 'u' attributes are not honored by the ext2,
          ext3, and ext4 file systems as implemented in the current
          mainline Linux kernels.  Setting 'a' and 'i' attributes will not
          affect the ability to write to already existing file descriptors.

          The 'j' option is only useful for ext3 and ext4 file systems.

          The 'D' option is only useful on Linux kernel 2.5.19 and later.
