   HASH(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               HASH(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          hash — remember or report utility locations


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          hash [utility...]

          hash -r


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The hash utility shall affect the way the current shell
          environment remembers the locations of utilities found as
          described in Section 2.9.1.1, Command Search and Execution.
          Depending on the arguments specified, it shall add utility
          locations to its list of remembered locations or it shall purge
          the contents of the list. When no arguments are specified, it
          shall report on the contents of the list.

          Utilities provided as built-ins to the shell shall not be
          reported by hash.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The hash utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

          The following option shall be supported:

          -r        Forget all previously remembered utility locations.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          utility   The name of a utility to be searched for and added to
                    the list of remembered locations. If utility contains
                    one or more <slash> characters, the results are
                    unspecified.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          hash:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.

          PATH      Determine the location of utility, as described in the
                    Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Chapter 8,
                    Environment Variables.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard output of hash shall be used when no arguments are
          specified. Its format is unspecified, but includes the pathname
          of each utility in the list of remembered locations for the
          current shell environment. This list shall consist of those
          utilities named in previous hash invocations that have been
          invoked, and may contain those invoked and found through the
          normal command search process.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Since hash affects the current shell execution environment, it is
          always provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is called in a
          separate utility execution environment, such as one of the
          following:

              nohup hash -r
              find . -type f | xargs hash

          it does not affect the command search process of the caller's
          environment.

          The hash utility may be implemented as an alias—for example,
          alias -t -, in which case utilities found through normal command
          search are not listed by the hash command.

          The effects of hash -r can also be achieved portably by resetting
          the value of PATH; in the simplest form, this can be:

              PATH="$PATH"

          The use of hash with utility names is unnecessary for most
          applications, but may provide a performance improvement on a few
          implementations; normally, the hashing process is included by
          default.
