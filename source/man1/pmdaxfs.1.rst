   PMDAXFS(1)               General Commands Manual              PMDAXFS(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaxfs - XFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs/pmdaxfs [-d domain] [-l logfile]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaxfs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          extracts performance metrics describing the state of the XFS
          filesystem from the Linux kernel.

          The xfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
          metadata buffer usage, the journal, btree operations, inode
          operations, extended attributes, directories, quotas, read and
          write operation counts and of course throughput.

          The PMDA provides a facility to reset the values of all counters
          to zero using pmstore(1) with the xfs.control.reset metric.

          A brief description of the pmdaxfs command line options follows:

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               xfs.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
               pmdaxfs is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
               file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
               to the standard error instead.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The xfs PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.  If
          you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
               # ./Remove

          If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
          values for the XFS performance metrics once more, after removal,
          do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/xfs
               # ./Install

          pmdaxfs is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
