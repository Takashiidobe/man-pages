   GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)             Git Manual             GIT-WHATCHANGED(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-whatchanged - Show logs with difference each commit
          introduces


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git whatchanged <option>...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Shows commit logs and diff output each commit introduces.

          New users are encouraged to use git-log(1) instead. The
          whatchanged command is essentially the same as git-log(1) but
          defaults to show the raw format diff output and to skip merges.

          The command is kept primarily for historical reasons; fingers of
          many people who learned Git long before git log was invented by
          reading Linux kernel mailing list are trained to type it.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git whatchanged -p v2.6.12.. include/scsi drivers/scsi
              Show as patches the commits since version v2.6.12 that
              changed any file in the include/scsi or drivers/scsi
              subdirectories

          git whatchanged --since="2 weeks ago" -- gitk
              Show the changes during the last two weeks to the file gitk.
              The "--" is necessary to avoid confusion with the branch
              named gitk
