          grodvi - groff output driver for TeX DVI format


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          grodvi [-dl] [-F dir] [-p papersize] [-w n] [file ...]

          grodvi --help

          grodvi -v

---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          grodvi is a driver for groff that produces TeX DVI format.
          Normally it should be run via “groff -Tdvi”.  This will run “‐
          troff -Tdvi”, read the macros in /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/
          tmac/dvi.tmac, and pipe the output to grodvi.

          The DVI file generated by grodvi can be printed by any correctly-
          written DVI driver.  troff drawing primitives are implemented
          using tpic version 2 specials.  If the driver does not support
          these, the \D commands will not produce any output.

          There is an additional drawing command available:

          \D'R dh dv'
                 Draw a rule (solid black rectangle), with one corner at
                 the current position, and the diagonally opposite corner
                 at the current position +(dh,dv).  Afterwards the current
                 position will be at the opposite corner.  This produces a
                 rule in the DVI file and so can be printed even with a
                 driver that does not support the tpic specials unlike the
                 other \D commands.

          The groff command \X'anything' is translated into the same
          command in the DVI file as would be produced by
          \special{anything} in TeX; anything may not contain a newline.

          For inclusion of EPS image files, -Tdvi loads pspic.tmac
          automatically, providing the .PSPIC macro.  See groff_tmac(5) for
          a detailed description.

          Font files for grodvi can be created from TFM (TeX font metrics)
          files using tfmtodit(1).  The font description file should
          contain the following additional commands:

          internalname name
                 The name of the TFM file (without the .tfm extension) is
                 name.

          checksum n
                 The checksum in the TFM file is n.

          designsize n
                 The designsize in the TFM file is n.

          These are automatically generated by tfmtodit.

          The default color for \m and \M is black.  Currently, the drawing
          color for \D commands is always black, and fill color values are
          translated to gray.

          In groff, as in AT&T troff, the \N escape sequence can be used to
          access characters by their position in the corresponding TFM
          file; all characters in the TFM file can be accessed this way.

          By design, the DVI format doesn't care about physical dimensions
          of the output medium.  Instead, grodvi emits the equivalent to
          TeX's \special{papersize=width,length} on the first page; dvips
          (and possibly other DVI drivers) then sets the page size
          accordingly.  If either the page width or length is not positive,
          no papersize special is output.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --help displays a usage message, while -v and --version show
          version information; all exit afterward.

          -d     Do not use tpic specials to implement drawing commands.
                 Horizontal and vertical lines will be implemented by
                 rules.  Other drawing commands will be ignored.

          -Fdir  Prepend directory dir/devname to the search path for font
                 and device description files; name is the name of the
                 device, usually dvi.

          -l     Specify landscape orientation.

          -ppapersize
                 Specify paper dimensions.  This overrides the papersize,
                 paperlength, and paperwidth commands in the DESC file; it
                 accepts the same arguments as the papersize command (see
                 groff_font(5) for details).

          -wn    Set the default line thickness to n thousandths of an em.
                 If this option isn't specified, the line thickness
                 defaults to 0.04 em.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          There are styles called R, I, B, and BI mounted at font positions
          1 to 4.  The fonts are grouped into families T and H having
          members in each of these styles:

                 TR     CM Roman (cmr10)
                 TI     CM Text Italic (cmti10)
                 TB     CM Bold Extended Roman (cmbx10)
                 TBI    CM Bold Extended Text Italic (cmbxti10)
                 HR     CM Sans Serif (cmss10)
                 HI     CM Slanted Sans Serif (cmssi10)
                 HB     CM Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbx10)
                 HBI    CM Slanted Sans Serif Bold Extended (cmssbxo10)

          There are also the following fonts which are not members of a
          family:

                 CW     CM Typewriter Text (cmtt10)
                 CWI    CM Italic Typewriter Text (cmitt10)

          Special fonts are MI (cmmi10), S (cmsy10), EX (cmex10), SC
          (cmtex10, only for CW), and, perhaps surprisingly, TR, TI, and
          CW, due to the different font encodings of text fonts.  For
          italic fonts, CWI is used instead of CW.

          Finally, the symbol fonts of the American Mathematical Society
          are available as special fonts SA (msam10) and SB (msbm10).
          These two fonts are not mounted by default.

          Using the option -mec (which loads the file ec.tmac) provides the
          EC and TC fonts.  The design of the EC family is very similar to
          that of the CM fonts; additionally, they give a much better
          coverage of groff symbols.  ec.tmac must be called before any
          language-specific files; it doesn't take care of .hcode values.

          GROFF_FONT_PATH
                 A list of directories in which to seek the selected output
                 device's directory of device and font description files.
                 See troff(1) and groff_font(5).

          /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devdvi/DESC
                 Device description file.

          /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/font/devdvi/F
                 Font description file for font F.

          /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/dvi.tmac
                 Macros for use with grodvi.

          /usr/local/share/groff/1.23.0/tmac/ec.tmac
                 Macros to switch to EC fonts.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          DVI files produced by grodvi use a different resolution (57816
          units per inch) from those produced by TeX.  Incorrectly written
          drivers which assume the resolution used by TeX, rather than
          using the resolution specified in the DVI file will not work with
          grodvi.

          When using the -d option with boxed tables, vertical and
          horizontal lines can sometimes protrude by one pixel.  This is a
          consequence of the way TeX requires that the heights and widths
          of rules be rounded.
