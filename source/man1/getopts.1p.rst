-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          getopts — parse utility options


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          getopts optstring name [arg...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The getopts utility shall retrieve options and option-arguments
          from a list of parameters. It shall support the Utility Syntax
          Guidelines 3 to 10, inclusive, described in the Base Definitions
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

          Each time it is invoked, the getopts utility shall place the
          value of the next option in the shell variable specified by the
          name operand and the index of the next argument to be processed
          in the shell variable OPTIND.  Whenever the shell is invoked,
          OPTIND shall be initialized to 1.

          When the option requires an option-argument, the getopts utility
          shall place it in the shell variable OPTARG.  If no option was
          found, or if the option that was found does not have an option-
          argument, OPTARG shall be unset.

          If an option character not contained in the optstring operand is
          found where an option character is expected, the shell variable
          specified by name shall be set to the <question-mark> ('?')
          character. In this case, if the first character in optstring is a
          <colon> (':'), the shell variable OPTARG shall be set to the
          option character found, but no output shall be written to
          standard error; otherwise, the shell variable OPTARG shall be
          unset and a diagnostic message shall be written to standard
          error. This condition shall be considered to be an error detected
          in the way arguments were presented to the invoking application,
          but shall not be an error in getopts processing.

          If an option-argument is missing:

           *  If the first character of optstring is a <colon>, the shell
              variable specified by name shall be set to the <colon>
              character and the shell variable OPTARG shall be set to the
              option character found.

           *  Otherwise, the shell variable specified by name shall be set
              to the <question-mark> character, the shell variable OPTARG
              shall be unset, and a diagnostic message shall be written to
              standard error. This condition shall be considered to be an
              error detected in the way arguments were presented to the
              invoking application, but shall not be an error in getopts
              processing; a diagnostic message shall be written as stated,
              but the exit status shall be zero.

          When the end of options is encountered, the getopts utility shall
          exit with a return value greater than zero; the shell variable
          OPTIND shall be set to the index of the first operand, or the
          value "$#"+1 if there are no operands; the name variable shall be
          set to the <question-mark> character. Any of the following shall
          identify the end of options: the first "--" argument that is not
          an option-argument, finding an argument that is not an option-
          argument and does not begin with a '-', or encountering an error.

          The shell variables OPTIND and OPTARG shall be local to the
          caller of getopts and shall not be exported by default.

          The shell variable specified by the name operand, OPTIND, and
          OPTARG shall affect the current shell execution environment; see
          Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment.

          If the application sets OPTIND to the value 1, a new set of
          parameters can be used: either the current positional parameters
          or new arg values. Any other attempt to invoke getopts multiple
          times in a single shell execution environment with parameters
          (positional parameters or arg operands) that are not the same in
          all invocations, or with an OPTIND value modified to be a value
          other than 1, produces unspecified results.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operands shall be supported:

          optstring A string containing the option characters recognized by
                    the utility invoking getopts.  If a character is
                    followed by a <colon>, the option shall be expected to
                    have an argument, which should be supplied as a
                    separate argument. Applications should specify an
                    option character and its option-argument as separate
                    arguments, but getopts shall interpret the characters
                    following an option character requiring arguments as an
                    argument whether or not this is done. An explicit null
                    option-argument need not be recognized if it is not
                    supplied as a separate argument when getopts is
                    invoked. (See also the getopt() function defined in the
                    System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017.) The
                    characters <question-mark> and <colon> shall not be
                    used as option characters by an application. The use of
                    other option characters that are not alphanumeric
                    produces unspecified results. If the option-argument is
                    not supplied as a separate argument from the option
                    character, the value in OPTARG shall be stripped of the
                    option character and the '-'.  The first character in
                    optstring determines how getopts behaves if an option
                    character is not known or an option-argument is
                    missing.

          name      The name of a shell variable that shall be set by the
                    getopts utility to the option character that was found.

          The getopts utility by default shall parse positional parameters
          passed to the invoking shell procedure. If args are given, they
          shall be parsed instead of the positional parameters.

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          getopts:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments and input files).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.

          OPTIND    This variable shall be used by the getopts utility as
                    the index of the next argument to be processed.

::

          Whenever an error is detected and the first character in the
          optstring operand is not a <colon> (':'), a diagnostic message
          shall be written to standard error with the following information
          in an unspecified format:

           *  The invoking program name shall be identified in the message.
              The invoking program name shall be the value of the shell
              special parameter 0 (see Section 2.5.2, Special Parameters)
              at the time the getopts utility is invoked. A name equivalent
              to:

                  basename "$0"

              may be used.

           *  If an option is found that was not specified in optstring,
              this error is identified and the invalid option character
              shall be identified in the message.

           *  If an option requiring an option-argument is found, but an
              option-argument is not found, this error shall be identified
              and the invalid option character shall be identified in the
              message.

           0    An option, specified or unspecified by optstring, was
                found.

          >0    The end of options was encountered or an error occurred.

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Since getopts affects the current shell execution environment, it
          is generally provided as a shell regular built-in. If it is
          called in a subshell or separate utility execution environment,
          such as one of the following:

              (getopts abc value "$@")
              nohup getopts ...
              find . -exec getopts ... \;

          it does not affect the shell variables in the caller's
          environment.

          Note that shell functions share OPTIND with the calling shell
          even though the positional parameters are changed. If the calling
          shell and any of its functions uses getopts to parse arguments,
          the results are unspecified.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following example script parses and displays its arguments:

              aflag=
              bflag=
              while getopts ab: name
              do
                  case $name in
                  a)    aflag=1;;
                  b)    bflag=1
                        bval="$OPTARG";;
                  ?)   printf "Usage: %s: [-a] [-b value] args\n" $0
                        exit 2;;
                  esac
              done
              if [ ! -z "$aflag" ]; then
                  printf "Option -a specified\n"
              fi
              if [ ! -z "$bflag" ]; then
                  printf 'Option -b "%s" specified\n' "$bval"
              fi
              shift $(($OPTIND - 1))
              printf "Remaining arguments are: %s\n$*"


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The getopts utility was chosen in preference to the System V
          getopt utility because getopts handles option-arguments
          containing <blank> characters.

          The OPTARG variable is not mentioned in the ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
          section because it does not affect the execution of getopts; it
          is one of the few ``output-only'' variables used by the standard
          utilities.

          The <colon> is not allowed as an option character because that is
          not historical behavior, and it violates the Utility Syntax
          Guidelines. The <colon> is now specified to behave as in the
          KornShell version of the getopts utility; when used as the first
          character in the optstring operand, it disables diagnostics
          concerning missing option-arguments and unexpected option
          characters. This replaces the use of the OPTERR variable that was
          specified in an early proposal.

          The formats of the diagnostic messages produced by the getopts
          utility and the getopt() function are not fully specified because
          implementations with superior (``friendlier'') formats objected
          to the formats used by some historical implementations. The
          standard developers considered it important that the information
          in the messages used be uniform between getopts and getopt().
          Exact duplication of the messages might not be possible,
          particularly if a utility is built on another system that has a
          different getopt() function, but the messages must have specific
          information included so that the program name, invalid option
          character, and type of error can be distinguished by a user.

          Only a rare application program intercepts a getopts standard
          error message and wants to parse it. Therefore, implementations
          are free to choose the most usable messages they can devise. The
          following formats are used by many historical implementations:

              "%s: illegal option -- %c\n", <program name>, <option character>

              "%s: option requires an argument -- %c\n", <program name>, \
                  <option character>

          Historical shells with built-in versions of getopt() or getopts
          have used different formats, frequently not even indicating the
          option character found in error.
