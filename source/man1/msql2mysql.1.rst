NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          msql2mysql - convert mSQL programs for use with MySQL


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          msql2mysqlC-source-file ...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Initially, the MySQL C API was developed to be very similar to
          that for the mSQL database system. Because of this, mSQL programs
          often can be converted relatively easily for use with MySQL by
          changing the names of the C API functions.

          The msql2mysql utility performs the conversion of mSQL C API
          function calls to their MySQL equivalents.  msql2mysql converts
          the input file in place, so make a copy of the original before
          converting it. For example, use msql2mysql like this:

              shell> cp client-prog.c client-prog.c.orig
              shell> msql2mysql client-prog.c
              client-prog.c converted

          Then examine client-prog.c and make any post-conversion revisions
          that may be necessary.

          msql2mysql uses the replace utility to make the function name
          substitutions. See replace(1).
