   PCP-PIDSTAT(1)           General Commands Manual          PCP-PIDSTAT(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp-pidstat - Report statistics for Linux tasks.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp [pcp options] pidstat [-I] [-l] [-R] [-r] [-k] [-U
          [username]] [-V] [-G processname] [-p pid1,pid2..]  [-t interval]
          [-s count] [-a archive] [-B state] [-f format] [-Z timezone] [-z]
          [-?]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The pcp-pidstat command is used for monitoring individual tasks
          running on the system.  Using various options it helps user to
          see useful information related to the processes.  This
          information includes CPU percentage, memory and stack usage,
          scheduling and priority.  By default pcp-pidstat reports live
          data for the local host.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          When invoked via the pcp(1) command, the -h/--host, -a/--archive,
          -O/--origin, -s/--samples, -t/--interval, -Z/--timezone and
          several other and several other pcp options become indirectly
          available; refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of
          these options.

          The additional command line options available for pcp-pidstat
          are:

          -I   In an SMP environment, indicates that tasks CPU usage should
               be divided by the total number of processors.

          -l   Display the process command name and all its arguments.

          -R   Report realtime priority and scheduling policy information.
               The following values may be displayed:

               UID

          -r   Report page faults and memory utilization.  The following
               values may be displayed:

               UID
                      The real user identification number of the task being
               monitored.

               USER
                      The name of the real user owning the task being
               monitored.

               PID
                      The identification number of the task being
               monitored.

               minflt/s
                      Total number of minor faults the task has made per
               second, those which have not required loading a memory page
               from disk.

               majflt/s
                      Total number of major faults the task has made per
               second, those which have required loading a memory page from
               disk.

               VSZ
                      Virtual Size: The virtual memory usage of entire task
               in kilobytes.

               RSS
                      Resident Set Size: The non-swapped physical memory

               memory.

               Command
                      The command name of the task.

          -k   Report stack utilization.  The following values may be
               displayed:

               UID
                     The real user identification number of the task being
               monitored.

               USER
                     The name of the real user owning the task being
               monitored.

               PID
                     The identification number of the task being monitored.

               StkSize
                     The amount of memory in kilobytes reserved for the
               task as stack, but not necessarily used.

               StkRef
                     The amount of memory in kilobytes used as stack,
               referenced by the task.

               Command
                     The command name of the task.

          -U [username], --user-name[=username]
               Display the real user name of the tasks being monitored
               instead of the UID.  If username is specified, then only
               tasks belonging to the specified user are displayed.

          -V, --version
               Print version number then exit.

          -G processname, --process-name=processname
               Display only processes whose command name includes the
               string processname.  This string can be a regular
               expression.

          -p pid1,pid2.., --pid-list=pid1,pid2..
               Display only processes with the listed PIDs.

          -t interval, --interval=interval
               Set the interval between two samples.  The default is one
               second.

          -s count, --samples=count
               Set the number of samples to be displayed.  Since the first
               sample is used for the rate conversion of some of the
               metrics, the total number of samples reported are one less
               than count.  The default is continous.

          -a archive, --archive=archive
               Causes pcp-pidstat to use the specified archive than
               connecting to PMCD.  The argument to -a is a comma-separated
               list of names, each of which may be the base name of an
               archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
               archives.

          -B   Report process states.  The argument to -B is one of the
               following:

               detail
                      Show total time processes have spent in each of the 5
               different states

               all
                      Show total time processes spent in their current
               state

               [R,S,T,D,Z]
                      A comma separated list of process states.  For
               example, -B R,S will report processes currently in either R
               or S states and not report processes currently in any other
               states.

          -f   Use the format string for formatting the timestamp.  The
               format will be used with the python(1) datetime.strftime
               method which is similar to that described in strftime(3).
               An empty format string (i.e, "") will remove the timestamps
               from the output.  The default with stdout is %H:%M:%S.

          -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
               By default, pcp-pidstat reports the time of day according to
               the local timezone on the system where pcp-pidstat is run.
               The -Z option changes the timezone to timezone in the format
               of the environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).

          -z , --hostzone
               Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
               host that is the source of the performance metrics.  When
               replaying a PCP archive that was captured in a foreign
               timezone, the -z option would almost always be used (the
               default reporting timezone is the local timezone, which may
               not be the same as the timezone of the PCP archive).

          -? , --help
               Display usage message and exit.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp-pidstat is inspired by the pidstat(1) command and aims to be
          command line and output compatible with it.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).

          For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
          pmGetOptions(3).
