   PMDANETCHECK(1)          General Commands Manual         PMDANETCHECK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdanetcheck - netcheck PMDA


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdanetcheck is a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) Performance Metrics
          Domain Agent (PMDA) which does basic network checks on the local
          host by using simple Python modules and, in some cases, external
          utilities such as ping(1).

          pmdanetcheck loads and acts as a bridge for any number of
          configured, separate PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules running
          Python code or external programs.  Existing Python modules and
          programs should be possible to be utilized with PCP netcheck PMDA
          modules with minimal effort.

          Note that on SELinux enabled systems for pmdanetcheck to be able
          to use the ping(1) command the pcp group must be able to create
          ICMP Echo sockets; please make sure the group id for pcp is
          included in the range at /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ping_group_range and
          refer to icmp(7) for more details on this.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdanetcheck reads a mandatory ini-style configuration file:

                 $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck.conf

          This file must contain a [pmda] section.  The following PMDA
          options are available (their default values are shown in
          parenthesis), options marked with asterisk (*) can be overridden
          in module-specific configuration sections:

          modules (unset)
                 The pmdanetcheck PMDA reads module-specific configuration
                 for each module listed in the comma-separated list of
                 modules (mandatory).

          hosts (DGW,DNS) *
                 A comma-separated list of hosts (optional) specifies the
                 hosts to run the checks for.  The special values DGW, DNS,
                 NTP will be translated to the default gateway, nameservers
                 listed in /etc/resolv.conf, and timeservers listed in
                 /etc/chrony.conf, respectively, on PMDA startup.

          background_check (True) *
                 A boolean value for background_check (optional) controls
                 whether to run checks constantly in the background or only
                 on demand.  Refer to the default configuration file for
                 more discussion about this.

          check_hosts_parallel (True) *
                 check_hosts_parallel (optional) controls whether modules
                 should check hosts one by one or in parallel.

          check_interval (1m) *
                 check_interval (optional) specifies the time interval
                 between two consecutive checks for hosts when checks are
                 done in the background.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
                 complete description of the syntax for the time interval.

          align_interval (True) *
                 align_interval (optional) specifies whether to take the
                 previous check duration into account when pausing between
                 checks.

          module_failure_fatal (True)
                 A boolean value for module_failure_fatal (optional)
                 controls whether a module failing to initialize should
                 cause the whole PMDA to abort (this is the default) or to
                 start up with possibly remaining functional modules.
                 Module configuration errors and internal errors (such as
                 failing to register the provided PMNS metrics, see
                 pmns(5)) will always cause the PMDA to fail to start.

          For each module listed in modules a corresponding [module]
          section must be defined.  Each [module] section can contain at
          least the following options (their default values are shown in
          parenthesis):

          timeout (1)
                 Force a hard timeout (optional) for each individual
                 network check operation.

          debug (False)
                 Enable logging of internal debug messages (rarely used).

          The module-specific options modules accept are described in the
          default configuration file.

          Modules expect basic network functionality to be present on the
          system, for example the localhost address being reachable.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          To install, the following must be done as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
              # ./Install

          To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck
              # ./Remove

          pmdanetcheck is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.

          In case module_failure_fatal is set to False, the PMDA
          installation will be considered successful if some (but not all)
          configured modules fail to load, in such cases metrics provided
          by the failing modules will not be available.  The pmdanetcheck
          agent log file (see below) will contain detailed information
          about activation of each module.

          Modules will provide real values only after having collected
          data.  For example, for the ping module the metric value is the
          exit value of the ping(1) command and for ping_latency the
          average packet latency as reported by ping(1).  For metrics
          indicating status, 0 denotes success.  In case a check has not
          finished yet its metric value is -1.  If a check was terminated
          during execution due to timeout the value is -2.

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck.conf
               configuration file for the pmdanetcheck agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/netcheck/*.{py,python}
               PCP netcheck PMDA Python modules for the pmdanetcheck agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/Install
               installation script for the pmdanetcheck agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/netcheck/Remove
               undo installation script for the pmdanetcheck agent

          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/netcheck.log
               default log file for messages from the pmdanetcheck agent

          Note that the usual/default value for $PCP_PMDAS_DIR is
          /var/lib/pcp/pmdas and the default for $PCP_LOG_DIR is
          /var/log/pcp but these settings are platform dependent.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
