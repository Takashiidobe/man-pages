   FLATPAK PIN(1)                 flatpak pin                FLATPAK PIN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak-pin - Pin runtimes to prevent automatic removal


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak pin [OPTION...] PATTERN...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Flatpak maintains a list of patterns that define which refs are
          pinned. A pinned ref will never be automatically uninstalled (as
          are unused runtimes periodically). This can be useful if for
          example you are using a runtime for development purposes.

          Runtimes that are explicitly installed, rather than installed as
          a dependency of something else, are automatically pinned.

          The patterns are just a partial ref, with the * character
          matching anything within that part of the ref. Only runtimes can
          be pinned, not apps. Here are some example patterns:

              org.some.Runtime
              org.some.Runtime//unstable
              runtime/org.domain.*
              org.some.Runtime/arm

          To list the current set of pins, run this command without any
          patterns.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following options are understood:

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

          --remove
              Instead of adding the patterns, remove matching patterns.

          --user
              Pin refs in a per-user installation.

          --system
              Pin refs in the default system-wide installation.

          --installation=NAME
              Pin refs in a system-wide installation specified by NAME
              among those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
              --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.

          -v, --verbose
              Print debug information during command processing.
