   IOSTAT2PCP(1)            General Commands Manual           IOSTAT2PCP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          iostat2pcp - import iostat data and create a PCP archive


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          iostat2pcp [-v] [-S start] [-t interval] [-Z timezone] infile
          outfile


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          iostat2pcp reads a text file created with iostat(1) (infile) and
          translates this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with
          the basename outfile.  If infile is ``-'' then iostat2pcp reads
          from standard input, allowing easy preprocessing of the iostat(1)
          output with sed(1) or similar.

          The resultant PCP archive may be used with all the PCP client
          tools to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
          reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
          pmie(1), etc.

          A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
          outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
          outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
          and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
          replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
          already, then iostat2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit
          with an error message.

          The first output sample from iostat(1) contains a statistical
          summary since boot time and is ignored by iostat2pcp, so the
          first real data set is the second one in the iostat(1) output.

          The best results are obtained when iostat(1) was run with its own
          -t flag, so each output sample is prefixed with a timestamp.
          Even better is -t with $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO set in environment when
          iostat(1) is run, in which case the timestamp includes the
          timezone.

          Note that if $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO is not used with the -t option
          then iostat(1) may produce a timestamp controlled by LC_TIME from
          the locale that is in a format iostat2pcp cannot parse.  The
          formats for the timestamp that iostat2pcp accepts are illustrated
          by these examples:

          2013-07-06T21:34:39+1000
              (for the $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO).

          2013-07-06 21:34:39
              (for some of the European formats, e.g. de_AT, de_BE, de_LU
              and en_DK.utf8).

          06/07/13 21:34:39
              (for all of the $LC_TIME settings for English locales outside
              North America, e.g. en_AU, en_GB, en_IE, en_NZ, en_SG and
              en_ZA, and all the Spanish locales, e.g. es_ES, es_MX and
              es_AR).

          In particular, note that some common North American $LC_TIME
          settings will not work with iostat2pcp (namely, en_US, POSIX and
          C) because they use the MM/DD format which may be incorrectly
          converted with the assumed DD/MM format.  This is another reason
          to recommend setting $S_TIME_FORMAT=ISO.

          If there are no timestamps in the input stream, iostat2pcp will
          try and deduce the sample interval if basic Disk data (-d option
          for iostat(1)) is found.  If this fails, then the -t option may
          be used to specify the sample interval in seconds.  This option
          is ignored if timestamps are found in the input stream.

          The -S option may be used to specify as start time for the first
          real sample in infile, where start must have the format HH:MM:SS.
          This option is ignored if timestamps are found in the input
          stream.

          The -Z option may be used to specify a timezone.  It must have
          the format +HHMM (for hours and minutes East of UTC) or -HHMM
          (for hours and minutes West of UTC).  Note in particular that
          neither the zoneinfo (aka Olson) format, e.g. Europe/Paris, nor
          the Posix TZ format, e.g.  EST+5 is allowed for the -Z option.
          This option is ignored if ISO timestamps are found in the input
          stream.  If the timezone is not specified and cannot be deduced,
          it defaults to ``UTC''.

          Some additional diagnostic output is generated with the -v
          option.

          iostat2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
          wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
          be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
          of performance data and create PCP archives.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -S start
               Specify the start time for the first sample.

          -t interval
               Specify the sample interval in seconds.

          -v   Print verbose output.

          -Z timezone
               Specify the timezone to use, see above.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          iostat2pcp requires infile to have been created by the version of
          iostat(1) from http://freshmeat.net/projects/sysstat .

          iostat2pcp handles the -c (CPU), -d (Disk), -x (eXtended Disk)
          and -p (Partition) report formats (including their -k, -m, -z and
          ALL variants), but does not accommodate the -n (Network
          Filesystem) report format from iostat(1); this is a demand-driven
          limitation rather than a technical limitation.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          iostat(1), pmchart(1), pmie(1), pmlogger(1), sed(1),
          Date::Format(3pm), Date::Parse(3pm), PCP::LogImport(3pm) and
          LOGIMPORT(3).
