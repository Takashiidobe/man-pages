   FG(1P)                  POSIX Programmer's Manual                 FG(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          fg — run jobs in the foreground


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          fg [job_id]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If job control is enabled (see the description of set -m), the fg
          utility shall move a background job from the current environment
          (see Section 2.12, Shell Execution Environment) into the
          foreground.

          Using fg to place a job into the foreground shall remove its
          process ID from the list of those ``known in the current shell
          execution environment''; see Section 2.9.3.1, Examples.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          job_id    Specify the job to be run as a foreground job. If no
                    job_id operand is given, the job_id for the job that
                    was most recently suspended, placed in the background,
                    or run as a background job shall be used. The format of
                    job_id is described in the Base Definitions volume of
                    POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.204, Job Control Job ID.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          fg:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The fg utility shall write the command line of the job to
          standard output in the following format:

              "%s\n", <command>


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If job control is disabled, the fg utility shall exit with an
          error and no job shall be placed in the foreground.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The fg utility does not work as expected when it is operating in
          its own utility execution environment because that environment
          has no applicable jobs to manipulate. See the APPLICATION USAGE
          section for bg(1p).  For this reason, fg is generally implemented
          as a shell regular built-in.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The extensions to the shell specified in this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 have mostly been based on features provided by the
          KornShell. The job control features provided by bg, fg, and jobs
          are also based on the KornShell. The standard developers examined
          the characteristics of the C shell versions of these utilities
          and found that differences exist. Despite widespread use of the C
          shell, the KornShell versions were selected for this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 to maintain a degree of uniformity with the rest of
          the KornShell features selected (such as the very popular command
          line editing features).


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.
