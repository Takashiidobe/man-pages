   QMOVE(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              QMOVE(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          qmove — move batch jobs


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          qmove destination job_identifier...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          To move a batch job is to remove the batch job from the batch
          queue in which it resides and instantiate the batch job in
          another batch queue.  A batch job is moved by a request to the
          batch server that manages the batch job. The qmove utility is a
          user-accessible batch client that requests the movement of one or
          more batch jobs.

          The qmove utility shall move those batch jobs, and only those
          batch jobs, for which a batch job_identifier is presented to the
          utility.

          The qmove utility shall move batch jobs in the order in which the
          corresponding batch job_identifiers are presented to the utility.

          If the qmove utility fails to process a batch job_identifier
          successfully, the utility shall proceed to process the remaining
          batch job_identifiers, if any.

          The qmove utility shall move batch jobs by sending a Move Job
          Request to the batch server that manages each batch job. The
          qmove utility shall not exit before the batch jobs corresponding
          to all successfully processed batch job_identifiers have been
          moved.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The qmove utility shall accept one operand that conforms to the
          syntax for a destination (see Section 3.3.2, Destination).

          The qmove utility shall accept one or more operands that conform
          to the syntax for a batch job_identifier (see Section 3.3.1,
          Batch Job Identifier).


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          qmove:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          LOGNAME   Determine the login name of the user.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          In addition to the default behavior, the qmove utility shall not
          be required to write a diagnostic message to standard error when
          the error reply received from a batch server indicates that the
          batch job_identifier does not exist on the server. Whether or not
          the qmove utility waits to output the diagnostic message while
          attempting to locate the job on other servers is implementation-
          defined.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The qmove utility allows users to move jobs between queues.

          The alternative to using the qmove utility—deleting the batch job
          and requeuing it—entails considerably more typing.

          Since the means of selecting jobs based on attributes has been
          encapsulated in the qselect utility, the only option of the qmove
          utility concerns authorization. The -u option provides the user
          with the convenience of changing the user identifier under which
          the batch job will execute. Minimalism and consistency have taken
          precedence over convenience; the -u option has been deleted
          because the equivalent capability exists with the -u option of
          the qalter utility.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The qmove utility may be removed in a future version.
