   PMDAMMV(1)               General Commands Manual              PMDAMMV(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdammv - memory mapped values performance metrics domain agent
          (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv/pmdammv [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U username]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdammv is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          exports application level performance metrics using memory mapped
          files.  It offers an extremely low overhead instrumentation
          facility that is well-suited to long running, mission critical
          applications where it is desirable to have performance metrics
          and availability information permanently enabled.

          The mmv PMDA exports instrumentation that has been added to an
          application using the MMV APIs (refer to mmv_stats_init(3) and
          mmv(5) for further details).  These APIs can be called from
          several languages, including C, C++, Perl, Python, Java (via the
          separate ``Parfait'' class library) and GoLang (via the separate
          ``Speed'' library).

          A brief description of the pmdammv command line options follows:

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               mmv.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
               pmdammv is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
               file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
               to the standard error instead.

          -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
               the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
               but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
               used by default.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Firstly, a security model for interprocess communication between
          instrumented applications and pmdammv (running as a shared
          library inside pmcd) must be chosen and established.

          This communication occurs through memory mapped files in a
          location known to both pmdammv and the instrumented applications.
          That location is $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv, although that is often hidden
          behind application APIs such as ``Parfait'' and
          mmv_stats_init(3).  The permissions set on this directory
          indicate the security model in use.

          The more secure method is to use an existing unprivileged group
          which is shared by instrumented applications, pmcd and pmdammv
          such as the "pcp" group.

               # . /etc/pcp.env
               # mkdir -m 775 $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
               # chgrp pcp $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv

          Since this method requires instrumented applications to use this
          non-default group (see newgrp(1) and setgid(2)) a common
          alternative involves the use of a world-writeable
          $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory with the sticky-bit set (similar to
          /tmp and /var/tmp, for example).

          This allows any application, running under any user account, to
          communicate with the PMDA (which runs under the "pcp" account by
          default).  This may not be desirable for all environments and one
          should consider the security implications of any directory setup
          like this (similar classes of issues exist as those that affect
          the system temporary file directories).

          pmdammv is enabled by default on all modern PCP installations,
          and thus the names, help text and values for the mmv performance
          metrics are available without the usual PMDA ./Install process.

          If the $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory does not exist, then the
          ./Install script can be used to create a world-writeable sticky-
          bit-set directory for communication.  This is for backwards
          compatibility, as well as ease of use - to use this mechanism, do
          the following as root:

               # rmdir $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv
               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
               # ./Install

          This installation process will not overwrite any existing
          $PCP_TMP_DIR/mmv directory.

          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/mmv
               # ./Remove

          pmdammv is launched by pmcd and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
          agent is installed or removed.

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
