   GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)              Git Manual              GIT-WRITE-TREE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-write-tree - Create a tree object from the current index


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git write-tree [--missing-ok] [--prefix=<prefix>/]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Creates a tree object using the current index. The name of the
          new tree object is printed to standard output.

          The index must be in a fully merged state.

          Conceptually, git write-tree sync()s the current index contents
          into a set of tree files. In order to have that match what is
          actually in your directory right now, you need to have done a git
          update-index phase before you did the git write-tree.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --missing-ok
              Normally git write-tree ensures that the objects referenced
              by the directory exist in the object database. This option
              disables this check.

          --prefix=<prefix>/
              Writes a tree object that represents a subdirectory <prefix>.
              This can be used to write the tree object for a subproject
              that is in the named subdirectory.
