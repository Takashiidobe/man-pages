   dpkg-split(1)                  dpkg suite                  dpkg-split(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dpkg-split - Debian package archive split/join tool


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dpkg-split [option...] command


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dpkg-split splits Debian binary package files into smaller parts
          and reassembles them again, to support the storage of large
          package files on small media such as floppy disks.

          It can be operated manually using the --split, --join and --info
          options.

          It also has an automatic mode, invoked using the --auto option,
          where it maintains a queue of parts seen but not yet reassembled
          and reassembles a package file when it has seen all of its parts.
          The --listq and --discard options allow the management of the
          queue.

          All splitting, joining and queueing operations produce
          informative messages on standard output; these may safely be
          ignored.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          -s, --split complete-archive [prefix]
                 Splits a single Debian binary package into several parts.

                 The parts are named prefix.NofM.deb where N is the part
                 number, starting at 1, and M is the total number of parts
                 (both in decimal).

                 If no prefix is supplied then the complete-archive
                 filename is taken, including directory, with any trailing
                 .deb removed.

          -j, --join part...
                 Joins the parts of a package file together, reassembling
                 the original file as it was before it was split.

                 The part files given as arguments must be all the parts of
                 exactly the same original binary file. Each part must
                 occur exactly once in the argument list, though the parts
                 to not need to be listed in order.

                 The parts must of course all have been generated with the
                 same part size specified at split time, which means that
                 they must usually have been generated by the same
                 invocation of dpkg-split --split.

                 The parts' filenames are not significant for the
                 reassembly process.

                 By default the output file is called
                 package_version_arch.deb.

          -I, --info part...
                 Prints information, in a human-readable format, about the
                 part file(s) specified. Arguments which are not binary
                 package parts produce a message saying so instead (but
                 still on standard output).

          -a, --auto -o complete-output part
                 Automatically queue parts and reassemble a package if
                 possible.

                 The part specified is examined, and compared with other
                 parts of the same package (if any) in the queue of
                 packages file parts.

                 If all parts of the package file of which part is a part
                 are available then the package is reassembled and written
                 to complete-output (which should not usually already
                 exist, though this is not an error).

                 If not then the part is copied into the queue and
                 complete-output is not created.

                 If part is not a split binary package part then dpkg-split
                 will exit with status 1; if some other trouble occurs then
                 it will exit with status 2.

                 The --output or -o option must be supplied when using
                 --auto.  (If this were not mandatory the calling program
                 would not know what output file to expect.)

          -l, --listq
                 Lists the contents of the queue of packages to be
                 reassembled.

                 For each package file of which parts are in the queue the
                 output gives the name of the package, the parts in the
                 queue, and the total number of bytes stored in the queue.

          -d, --discard [package...]
                 This discards parts from the queue of those waiting for
                 the remaining parts of their packages.

                 If no package is specified then the queue is cleared
                 completely; if any are specified then only parts of the
                 relevant package(s) are deleted.

          -?, --help
                 Show the usage message and exit.

          --version
                 Show the version and exit.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --depotdir directory
                 Specifies an alternative directory for the queue of parts
                 awaiting automatic reassembly. The default is
                 /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg.

          -S, --partsize kibibytes
                 Specifies the maximum part size when splitting, in
                 kibibytes (1024 bytes). The default is 450 KiB.

          -o, --output complete-output
                 Specifies the output file name for a reassembly.

                 This overrides the default for a manual reassembly
                 (--join) and is mandatory for an automatic queue-or-
                 reassemble (--auto).

          -Q, --npquiet
                 When doing automatic queue-or-reassembly dpkg-split
                 usually prints a message if it is given a part that is not
                 a binary package part. This option suppresses this
                 message, to allow programs such as dpkg to cope with both
                 split and unsplit packages without producing spurious
                 messages.

          --msdos
                 Forces the output filenames generated by --split to be
                 msdos-compatible.

                 This mangles the prefix - either the default derived from
                 the input filename or the one supplied as an argument:
                 alphanumerics are lowercased, plus signs are replaced by
                 x's and all other characters are discarded.

                 The result is then truncated as much as is necessary, and
                 filenames of the form prefixNofM.deb are generated.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          0      The requested split, merge, or other command succeeded.
                 --info commands count as successful even if the files are
                 not binary package parts.

          1      Only occurs with --auto and indicates that the part file
                 was not a binary package part.

          2      Fatal or unrecoverable error due to invalid command-line
                 usage, a file that looked like a package part file but was
                 corrupted, or interactions with the system, such as
                 accesses to the database, memory allocations, etc.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          DPKG_COLORS
                 Sets the color mode (since dpkg 1.18.5).  The currently
                 accepted values are: auto (default), always and never.

          SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH
                 If set, it will be used as the timestamp (as seconds since
                 the epoch) in the deb-split(5)'s ar(5) container.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          /usr/local/var/lib/dpkg/parts
                 The default queue directory for part files awaiting
                 automatic reassembly.

                 The filenames used in this directory are in a format
                 internal to dpkg-split and are unlikely to be useful to
                 other programs, and in any case the filename format should
                 not be relied upon.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Full details of the packages in the queue are impossible to get
          without digging into the queue directory yourself.

          There is no easy way to test whether a file that may be a binary
          package part is one.
