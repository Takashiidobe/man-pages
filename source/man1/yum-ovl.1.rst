   yum-ovl(1)                     User Manual                    yum-ovl(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          yum-ovl - Performs an initial copy-up of yum(8) package database.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -d debug-level If debug level is 2 and more, print out the number
          of files copied up from the lower layer


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Opening a file on OverlayFS in read-only mode causes the file
          from
          lower layer to be opened, then later on, if the same file is
          opened
          in write mode, a copy-up into the upper    layer    takes
          place,
          resulting into a new file being opened.
          Since yum(8) needs to open the RPMdb first read-only, and then
          also with write access, we need to copy-up the files beforehand
          to
          make sure that the access is consistent.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          /usr/lib/yum-plugins/ovl.py Plugin itself

          /etc/yum/pluginconf.d/ovl.conf Configuration file allowing to
          enable/disable the plugin
