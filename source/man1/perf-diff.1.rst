   PERF-DIFF(1)                   perf Manual                  PERF-DIFF(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          perf-diff - Read perf.data files and display the differential
          profile


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          perf diff [baseline file] [data file1] [[data file2] ... ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This command displays the performance difference amongst two or
          more perf.data files captured via perf record.

          If no parameters are passed it will assume perf.data.old and
          perf.data.

          The differential profile is displayed only for events matching
          both specified perf.data files.

          If no parameters are passed the samples will be sorted by dso and
          symbol. As the perf.data files could come from different
          binaries, the symbols addresses could vary. So perf diff is based
          on the comparison of the files and symbols name.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -D, --dump-raw-trace
              Dump raw trace in ASCII.

          --kallsyms=<file>
              kallsyms pathname

          -m, --modules
              Load module symbols. WARNING: use only with -k and LIVE
              kernel

          -d, --dsos=
              Only consider symbols in these dsos. CSV that understands
              file://filename entries. This option will affect the
              percentage of the Baseline/Delta column. See --percentage for
              more info.

          -C, --comms=
              Only consider symbols in these comms. CSV that understands
              file://filename entries. This option will affect the
              percentage of the Baseline/Delta column. See --percentage for
              more info.

          -S, --symbols=
              Only consider these symbols. CSV that understands
              file://filename entries. This option will affect the
              percentage of the Baseline/Delta column. See --percentage for
              more info.

          -s, --sort=
              Sort by key(s): pid, comm, dso, symbol, cpu, parent, srcline.
              Please see description of --sort in the perf-report man page.

          -t, --field-separator=
              Use a special separator character and don’t pad with spaces,
              replacing all occurrences of this separator in symbol names
              (and other output) with a .  character, that thus it’s the
              only non valid separator.

          -v, --verbose
              Be verbose, for instance, show the raw counts in addition to
              the diff.

          -q, --quiet
              Do not show any message. (Suppress -v)

          -f, --force
              Don’t do ownership validation.

          --symfs=<directory>
              Look for files with symbols relative to this directory.

          -b, --baseline-only
              Show only items with match in baseline.

          -c, --compute
              Differential computation selection - delta, ratio, wdiff,
              cycles, delta-abs (default is delta-abs). Default can be
              changed using diff.compute config option. See COMPARISON
              METHODS section for more info.

          --cycles-hist
              Report a histogram and the standard deviation for cycles
              data. It can help us to judge if the reported cycles data is
              noisy or not. This option should be used with -c cycles.

          -p, --period
              Show period values for both compared hist entries.

          -F, --formula
              Show formula for given computation.

          -o, --order
              Specify compute sorting column number. 0 means sorting by
              baseline overhead and 1 (default) means sorting by computed
              value of column 1 (data from the first file other base
              baseline). Values more than 1 can be used only if enough data
              files are provided. The default value can be set using the
              diff.order config option.

          --percentage
              Determine how to display the overhead percentage of filtered
              entries. Filters can be applied by --comms, --dsos and/or
              --symbols options.

                  "relative" means it's relative to filtered entries only so that the
                  sum of shown entries will be always 100%.  "absolute" means it retains
                  the original value before and after the filter is applied.

          --time
              Analyze samples within given time window. It supports time
              percent with multiple time ranges. Time string is
              a%/n,b%/m,...  or a%-b%,c%-%d,....

                  For example:

                  Select the second 10% time slice to diff:

                  perf diff --time 10%/2

                  Select from 0% to 10% time slice to diff:

                  perf diff --time 0%-10%

                  Select the first and the second 10% time slices to diff:

                  perf diff --time 10%/1,10%/2

                  Select from 0% to 10% and 30% to 40% slices to diff:

                  perf diff --time 0%-10%,30%-40%

                  It also supports analyzing samples within a given time window
                  <start>,<stop>. Times have the format seconds.nanoseconds. If 'start'
                  is not given (i.e. time string is ',x.y') then analysis starts at
                  the beginning of the file. If stop time is not given (i.e. time
                  string is 'x.y,') then analysis goes to the end of the file.
                  Multiple ranges can be separated by spaces, which requires the argument
                  to be quoted e.g. --time "1234.567,1234.789 1235,"
                  Time string is'a1.b1,c1.d1:a2.b2,c2.d2'. Use ':' to separate timestamps
                  for different perf.data files.

                  For example, we get the timestamp information from 'perf script'.

                  perf script -i perf.data.old
                    mgen 13940 [000]  3946.361400: ...

                  perf script -i perf.data
                    mgen 13940 [000]  3971.150589 ...

                  perf diff --time 3946.361400,:3971.150589,

                  It analyzes the perf.data.old from the timestamp 3946.361400 to
                  the end of perf.data.old and analyzes the perf.data from the
                  timestamp 3971.150589 to the end of perf.data.

          --cpu
              Only diff samples for the list of CPUs provided. Multiple
              CPUs can be provided as a comma-separated list with no space:
              0,1. Ranges of CPUs are specified with -: 0-2. Default is to
              report samples on all CPUs.

          --pid=
              Only diff samples for given process ID (comma separated
              list).

          --tid=
              Only diff samples for given thread ID (comma separated list).

          --stream
              Enable hot streams comparison. Stream can be a callchain
              which is aggregated by the branch records from samples.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The comparison is governed by the baseline file. The baseline
          perf.data file is iterated for samples. All other perf.data files
          specified on the command line are searched for the baseline
          sample pair. If the pair is found, specified computation is made
          and result is displayed.

          All samples from non-baseline perf.data files, that do not match
          any baseline entry, are displayed with empty space within
          baseline column and possible computation results (delta) in their
          related column.

          Example files samples: - file A with samples f1, f2, f3, f4, f6 -
          file B with samples f2, f4, f5 - file C with samples f1, f2, f5

          Example output: x - computation takes place for pair b - baseline
          sample percentage

      delta
          If specified the Delta column is displayed with value d computed
          as:

              d = A->period_percent - B->period_percent

          with: - A/B being matching hist entry from data/baseline file
          specified (or perf.data/perf.data.old) respectively.

          •   period_percent being the % of the hist entry period value
              within single data file

          •   with filtering by -C, -d and/or -S, period_percent might be
              changed relative to how entries are filtered. Use
              --percentage=absolute to prevent such fluctuation.

      delta-abs
          Same as 'delta` method, but sort the result with the absolute
          values.

      ratio
          If specified the Ratio column is displayed with value r computed
          as:

              r = A->period / B->period

          with: - A/B being matching hist entry from data/baseline file
          specified (or perf.data/perf.data.old) respectively.

          •   period being the hist entry period value

      wdiff:WEIGHT-B,WEIGHT-A
          If specified the Weighted diff column is displayed with value d
          computed as:

              d = B->period * WEIGHT-A - A->period * WEIGHT-B

          •   A/B being matching hist entry from data/baseline file
              specified (or perf.data/perf.data.old) respectively.

          •   period being the hist entry period value

          •   WEIGHT-A/WEIGHT-B being user supplied weights in the the -c
              option behind : separator like -c wdiff:1,2.

          •   WEIGHT-A being the weight of the data file

          •   WEIGHT-B being the weight of the baseline data file

      cycles
          If specified the [Program Block Range] Cycles Diff column is
          displayed. It displays the cycles difference of same program
          basic block amongst two perf.data. The program basic block is the
          code between two branches.

          [Program Block Range] indicates the range of a program basic
          block. Source line is reported if it can be found otherwise uses
          symbol+offset instead.
