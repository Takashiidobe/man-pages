   FLATPAK(1)                       flatpak                      FLATPAK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak - Build, install and run applications and runtimes


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak [OPTION...] {COMMAND}


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Flatpak is a tool for managing applications and the runtimes they
          use. In the Flatpak model, applications can be built and
          distributed independently from the host system they are used on,
          and they are isolated from the host system ('sandboxed') to some
          degree, at runtime.

          Flatpak can operate in system-wide or per-user mode. The
          system-wide data (runtimes, applications and configuration) is
          located in $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, and the per-user data is in
          $HOME/.local/share/flatpak/. Below these locations, there is a
          local repository in the repo/ subdirectory and installed runtimes
          and applications are in the corresponding runtime/ and app/
          subdirectories.

          System-wide remotes can be statically preconfigured by dropping
          flatpakrepo files into /etc/flatpak/remotes.d/.

          In addition to the system-wide installation in
          $prefix/var/lib/flatpak/, which is always considered the default
          one unless overridden, more system-wide installations can be
          defined via configuration files in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/,
          which must define at least the id of the installation and the
          absolute path to it. Other optional parameters like DisplayName,
          Priority or StorageType are also supported.

          Flatpak uses OSTree to distribute and deploy data. The
          repositories it uses are OSTree repositories and can be
          manipulated with the ostree utility. Installed runtimes and
          applications are OSTree checkouts.

          Basic commands for building flatpaks such as build-init, build
          and build-finish are included in the flatpak utility. For
          higher-level build support, see the separate flatpak-builder(1)
          tool.

          Flatpak supports installing from sideload repos. These are
          partial copies of a repository (generated by flatpak create-usb)
          that are used as installation source when offline (and online as
          a performance improvement). Such repositories are configured by
          creating symlinks to the sideload sources in the sideload-repos
          subdirectory of the installation directory (i.e. typically
          /var/lib/flatpak/sideload-repos). Additionally symlinks can be
          created in /run/flatpak/sideload-repos which is a better location
          for non-persistent sources (as it is cleared on reboot). These
          symlinks can point to either the directory given to flatpak
          create-usb which by default writes to the subpath .ostree/repo,
          or directly to an ostree repo.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following global options are understood. Individual commands
          have their own options.

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

          -v, --verbose
              Show debug information during command processing. Use -vv for
              more detail.

          --ostree-verbose
              Show OSTree debug information during command processing.

          --version
              Print version information and exit.

          --default-arch
              Print the default arch and exit.

          --supported-arches
              Print the supported arches in priority order and exit.

          --gl-drivers
              Print the list of active gl drivers and exit.

          --installations
              Print paths of system installations and exit.

          --print-system-only
              When the flatpak --print-updated-env command is run, only
              print the environment for system flatpak installations, not
              including the user’s home installation.

          --print-updated-env
              Print the set of environment variables needed to use
              flatpaks, amending the current set of environment variables.
              This is intended to be used in a systemd environment
              generator, and should not need to be run manually.

-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          File formats that are used by Flatpak commands:

          flatpak-flatpakref(5)
              Reference to a remote for an application or runtime

          flatpak-flatpakrepo(5)
              Reference to a remote

          flatpak-remote(5)
              Configuration for a remote

          flatpak-installation(5)
              Configuration for an installation location

          flatpak-metadata(5)
              Information about an application or runtime


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Besides standard environment variables such as XDG_DATA_DIRS and
          XDG_DATA_HOME, flatpak is consulting some of its own.

          FLATPAK_USER_DIR
              The location of the per-user installation. If this is not
              set, $XDG_DATA_HOME/flatpak is used.

          FLATPAK_SYSTEM_DIR
              The location of the default system-wide installation. If this
              is not set, /var/lib/flatpak is used (unless overridden at
              build time by --localstatedir or --with-system-install-dir).

          FLATPAK_SYSTEM_CACHE_DIR
              The location where temporary child repositories will be
              created during pulls into the system-wide installation. If
              this is not set, a directory in /var/tmp/ is used. This is
              useful because it is more likely to be on the same filesystem
              as the system repository (thus increasing the chances for
              e.g. reflink copying), and we can avoid filling the user's
              home directory with temporary data.

          FLATPAK_CONFIG_DIR
              The location of flatpak site configuration. If this is not
              set, /etc/flatpak is used (unless overridden at build time by
              --sysconfdir).

          FLATPAK_RUN_DIR
              The location of flatpak runtime global files. If this is not
              set, /run/flatpak is used.
