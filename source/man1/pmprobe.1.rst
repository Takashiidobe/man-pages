   PMPROBE(1)               General Commands Manual              PMPROBE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmprobe - lightweight probe for performance metrics


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmprobe [-dfFiILvVz?]  [-a archive] [-b batchsize]
          [--container=name] [--derived=file] [-h hostname] [-K spec] [-n
          pmnsfile] [-O time] [-Z timezone] [metricname ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmprobe determines the availability of performance metrics
          exported through the facilities of the Performance Co-Pilot
          (PCP).

          The metrics of interest are named in the metricname arguments.
          If metricname is a non-leaf node in the Performance Metrics Name
          Space (PMNS(5)), then pmprobe will recursively descend the PMNS
          and report on all leaf nodes.  If no metricname argument is
          given, the root of the namespace is used.

          This recursive expansion of the PMNS can be inhibited by the -F
          (go faster) option, which reduces the number of roundtrips to
          pmcd(1) when the metricname arguments are known to be leaf nodes
          ahead of time.

          The output format is spartan and intended for use in wrapper
          scripts creating configuration files for other PCP tools.  By
          default, there is one line of output per metric, with the metric
          name followed by a count of the number of available values.
          Error conditions are encoded as a negative value count (as per
          the PMAPI(3) protocols, but may be decoded using pmerr(1)) and
          followed by a textual description of the error.

          Unless directed to another host by the -h option, pmprobe will
          contact the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the
          local host.

          The -a option causes pmprobe to use the specified set of archives
          rather than connecting to a PMCD.

          The -L option causes pmprobe to use a local context to collect
          metrics from PMDAs on the local host without PMCD.  Only some
          metrics are available in this mode.

          The -a, -h and -L options are mutually exclusive.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -a archive, --archive=archive
               Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
               Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
               the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
               names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
               the name of a directory containing one or more archives.

          -b, --batch
               This option may be used to define the maximum number of
               metrics to be fetched in a single request for the -v option
               and any pmLookupName(3) request that pmprobe calls with a
               list of leaf metric names.  The default value for batchsize
               is 128.  This option is useful to avoid limitations on PDU
               request sizes and also to stagger fetches, which may
               otherwise timeout if pmcd(1) or a PMDA is slow to respond,
               particularly if a large number of metrics are probed.

          --container=container
               Specify an individual container to be queried.

          -d, --version
               Display version number and exit.

          --derived=dmfile
               The dmfile argument specifies a file that contains derived
               metric definitions in the format described for
               pmLoadDerivedConfig(3).  This option provides a way to load
               derived metric definitions that is an alternative to the
               more generic use of the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment
               variable as described in PCPIntro(1).  Using the --derived
               option and the PCP_DERIVED_CONFIG environment variable to
               specify the same configuration is a bad idea, so choose one
               or the other method.

          -f, --force
               When used with -i or -I the set of instances reported will
               be all of those known at the source of the performance data.
               By default the set of reported instances are those for which
               values are currently available, which may be smaller than
               the set reported with -f.

          -F, --faster
               Assume given metric names are PMNS leaf nodes.

          -h host, --host=host
               Connect to pmcd(1) on host, rather than on the default
               localhost.

          -i, --internal
               Report the internal identifiers for each instance.  The
               values are in decimal and prefixed by ``?''.  As a special
               case, the literal string PM_IN_NULL is reported for singular
               metrics.

          -I, --external
               Report the external identifiers for each instance.  The
               literal string PM_IN_NULL is reported for singular metrics.

          -K spec, --spec-local=spec
               When using the -L/ option to fetch metrics from a local
               context, this option controls the DSO PMDAs that should be
               made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
               described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
               may be used.

          -L, --local-PMDA
               Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
               local host without PMCD.  See also -K.

          -n pmnsfile, --namespace=pmnsfile
               Normally pmprobe operates on the distributed Performance
               Metrics Name Space (PMNS), however, if the -n option is
               specified an alternative local PMNS file is loaded from the
               file pmnsfile.

          -O time, --origin=time
               When used in conjunction with an archive source of metrics
               and the options -f/, the time argument defines a time origin
               at which the metrics should be fetched from the set of
               archives.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description
               of this option, and the syntax for the time argument.

          -v, --values
               Report the value for each instance, as per the formatting
               rules of pmPrintValue(3).  When fetching from a set of
               archives, only those instances present in the first archive
               record for a metric will be displayed; see also the -O
               option.  The -v option is mutually exclusive with either the
               -I or -i options.

          -V, --verbose
               This option provides a cryptic summary of the number of
               messages sent and received across the PMAPI interface.

          -z, --hostzone
               Change the reporting timezone to the local timezone at the
               host that is the source of the performance metrics, as
               identified via either the -h or -a options.

          -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
               By default, pmprobe reports the time of day according to the
               local timezone on the system where pmprobe is run.  The -Z
               option changes the timezone to timezone in the format of the
               environment variable TZ as described in environ(7).

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).

          For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
          pmGetOptions(3).
