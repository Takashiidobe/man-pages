   PMDAPIPE(1)              General Commands Manual             PMDAPIPE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdapipe - command output capture performance metrics domain
          agent (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pmdapipe [-c configfile] [-d domain] [-l
          logfile] [-m memory]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdapipe is a configurable command output monitoring Performance
          Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA).  It can be seen as analogous to a
          restricted shell, where options can be passed to preset commands,
          and each line of their output is converted into a performance
          event.  These events can be consumed by client tools like
          pmval(1).

          The pipe PMDA exports both event-style metrics reflecting
          timestamped event records for text-oriented command output, as
          well as the more orthodox sample-style metrics such as event
          counts and throughput size values.

          The PMDA is configured via a configfile which contains one line
          for each process from which output can be captured, as described
          in the ``CONFIGURATION'' section below.

          A brief description of the pmdapipe command line options follows:

          -c   specifies an alternate configuration file for the PMDA.  By
               default, a file named $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf and any
               files below the $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pipe.conf.d/ directory are
               used.

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               pipe.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
               pmdapipe is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
               file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
               to the standard error instead.

          -m   Limit the physical memory used by the PMDA to buffer event
               records to maxsize bytes.  As log events arrive at the PMDA,
               they must be buffered until individual client tools request
               the next batch since their previous batch of events.  The
               default maximum is 2 megabytes.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The set of allowed pipe commands is configured by simple text
          file(s).  The format is a single line for each command followed
          by an optional access control section.

          Blank lines and comments are permitted (even encouraged) in the
          configuration file.  A comment begins with a ``#'' character and
          finishes at the end of the line.

          Each command configuration line is of the form:

                 instance username command options

          Where,

          instance
                 is a string identifying the pipe command, also exported as
                 the metric instance identifier.
          username
                 is the name of the user account under which the command
                 should run (e.g. "root")
          command
                 is the path to the binary which will be run to generate
                 piped output
          options
                 is an optional space-separated list of parameters to pass
                 to the command

                        This options list may contain numeric parameters
                        prefixed by the dollar-sign, and these will be
                        substituted with user-supplied values at the time
                        the command is run (similar to shell parameter
                        substitution).

          Parameters are passed as a single space-separated or comma-
          separated string to the pipe.firehose metric, using the
          pmStore(3) interface.  The pmval command provides store access
          via its -x option.  User-supplied parameters are restricted to
          containing alphanumeric characters.

          The access control section of the file must start with a line of
          the form:

          [access]

          Leading and trailing whitespace may appear around and within the
          brackets and the case of the access keyword is ignored.  No other
          text may appear on the line except a trailing comment.

          Following this line, the remainder of the configuration file
          should contain lines that allow or disallow use of commands from
          particular users or groups.

          User names and group names will be verified using the local
          /etc/passwd and /etc/groups files (or an alternative directory
          service), using the getpwent(3) and getgrent(3) routines.

          Access for users or groups are allowed or disallowed by
          specifying statements of the form:

                 allow user username : instance
                 disallow user username : instance
                 allow group groupname : instance
                 disallow group groupname : instance

          The username and groupname names will be verified using the local
          /etc/passwd and /etc/groups files (or an alternative directory
          service), using the getpwent(3) and getgrent(3) routines.

          The wildcard ``*'' can be used to refer to all instance names.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
          pipe performance metrics, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
               # ./Install

          This is an interactive installation process which prompts for
          each log file path to be monitored (or command to be run), a
          metric instance name to identify it, and whether access should be
          restricted (refer to the -x option to pmval(1) for further
          details).

          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe
               # ./Remove

          pmdapipe is launched by pmcd and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
          agent is installed or removed.


---------------------------------------------------------

          Following is a simple example of pmdapipe configuration and use
          of the pipe metrics to run the btrace command, by user bob:

               bob> cat $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/pipe/pipe.conf
               # instance      user      command
               rw_syscalls     root      perf script rw-by-file $1
               bdev_trace      root      btrace -w $1 /dev/$2

               [access]
               allow user bob : *;
               allow user jane : bdev_trace;
               allow group perf : rw_syscalls;

               bob> pmval -i bdev_trace -x '5 sda' pipe.firehose

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
