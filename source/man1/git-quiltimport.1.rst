NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-quiltimport - Applies a quilt patchset onto the current
          branch


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git quiltimport [--dry-run | -n] [--author <author>] [--patches <dir>]
                          [--series <file>] [--keep-non-patch]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Applies a quilt patchset onto the current Git branch, preserving
          the patch boundaries, patch order, and patch descriptions present
          in the quilt patchset.

          For each patch the code attempts to extract the author from the
          patch description. If that fails it falls back to the author
          specified with --author. If the --author flag was not given the
          patch description is displayed and the user is asked to
          interactively enter the author of the patch.

          If a subject is not found in the patch description the patch name
          is preserved as the 1 line subject in the Git description.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n, --dry-run
              Walk through the patches in the series and warn if we cannot
              find all of the necessary information to commit a patch. At
              the time of this writing only missing author information is
              warned about.

          --author Author Name <Author Email>
              The author name and email address to use when no author
              information can be found in the patch description.

          --patches <dir>
              The directory to find the quilt patches.

              The default for the patch directory is patches or the value
              of the $QUILT_PATCHES environment variable.

          --series <file>
              The quilt series file.

              The default for the series file is <patches>/series or the
              value of the $QUILT_SERIES environment variable.

          --keep-non-patch
              Pass -b flag to git mailinfo (see git-mailinfo(1)).
