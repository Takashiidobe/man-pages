   HEAD(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               HEAD(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          head — copy the first part of files


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          head [-n number] [file...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The head utility shall copy its input files to the standard
          output, ending the output for each file at a designated point.

          Copying shall end at the point in each input file indicated by
          the -n number option. The option-argument number shall be counted
          in units of lines.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The head utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

          The following option shall be supported:

          -n number The first number lines of each input file shall be
                    copied to standard output. The application shall ensure
                    that the number option-argument is a positive decimal
                    integer.

          When a file contains less than number lines, it shall be copied
          to standard output in its entirety. This shall not be an error.

          If no options are specified, head shall act as if -n 10 had been
          specified.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          file      A pathname of an input file. If no file operands are
                    specified, the standard input shall be used.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard input shall be used if no file operands are
          specified, and shall be used if a file operand is '-' and the
          implementation treats the '-' as meaning standard input.
          Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
          FILES section.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Input files shall be text files, but the line length is not
          restricted to {LINE_MAX} bytes.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          head:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments and input files).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard output shall contain designated portions of the
          input files.

          If multiple file operands are specified, head shall precede the
          output for each with the header:

              "\n==> %s <==\n", <pathname>

          except that the first header written shall not include the
          initial <newline>.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          When using head to process pathnames, it is recommended that
          LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
          C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
          that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
          the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
          each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
          problem is avoided.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          To write the first ten lines of all files (except those with a
          leading period) in the directory:

              head -- *


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          Although it is possible to simulate head with sed 10q for a
          single file, the standard developers decided that the popularity
          of head on historical BSD systems warranted its inclusion
          alongside tail.

          POSIX.1‐2008 version of head follows the Utility Syntax
          Guidelines. The -n option was added to this new interface so that
          head and tail would be more logically related. Earlier versions
          of this standard allowed a -number option. This form is no longer
          specified by POSIX.1‐2008 but may be present in some
          implementations.

          There is no -c option (as there is in tail) because it is not
          historical practice and because other utilities in this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 provide similar functionality.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.
