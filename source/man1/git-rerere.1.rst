   GIT-RERERE(1)                  Git Manual                  GIT-RERERE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-rerere - Reuse recorded resolution of conflicted merges


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git rerere [clear|forget <pathspec>|diff|remaining|status|gc]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          In a workflow employing relatively long lived topic branches, the
          developer sometimes needs to resolve the same conflicts over and
          over again until the topic branches are done (either merged to
          the "release" branch, or sent out and accepted upstream).

          This command assists the developer in this process by recording
          conflicted automerge results and corresponding hand resolve
          results on the initial manual merge, and applying previously
          recorded hand resolutions to their corresponding automerge
          results.

              Note
              You need to set the configuration variable rerere.enabled in
              order to enable this command.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Normally, git rerere is run without arguments or
          user-intervention. However, it has several commands that allow it
          to interact with its working state.

          clear
              Reset the metadata used by rerere if a merge resolution is to
              be aborted. Calling git am [--skip|--abort] or git rebase
              [--skip|--abort] will automatically invoke this command.

          forget <pathspec>
              Reset the conflict resolutions which rerere has recorded for
              the current conflict in <pathspec>.

          diff
              Display diffs for the current state of the resolution. It is
              useful for tracking what has changed while the user is
              resolving conflicts. Additional arguments are passed directly
              to the system diff command installed in PATH.

          status
              Print paths with conflicts whose merge resolution rerere will
              record.

          remaining
              Print paths with conflicts that have not been autoresolved by
              rerere. This includes paths whose resolutions cannot be
              tracked by rerere, such as conflicting submodules.

          gc
              Prune records of conflicted merges that occurred a long time
              ago. By default, unresolved conflicts older than 15 days and
              resolved conflicts older than 60 days are pruned. These
              defaults are controlled via the gc.rerereUnresolved and
              gc.rerereResolved configuration variables respectively.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          When your topic branch modifies an overlapping area that your
          master branch (or upstream) touched since your topic branch
          forked from it, you may want to test it with the latest master,
          even before your topic branch is ready to be pushed upstream:

                            o---*---o topic
                           /
                  o---o---o---*---o---o master

          For such a test, you need to merge master and topic somehow. One
          way to do it is to pull master into the topic branch:

                      $ git switch topic
                      $ git merge master

                            o---*---o---+ topic
                           /           /
                  o---o---o---*---o---o master

          The commits marked with * touch the same area in the same file;
          you need to resolve the conflicts when creating the commit marked
          with +. Then you can test the result to make sure your
          work-in-progress still works with what is in the latest master.

          After this test merge, there are two ways to continue your work
          on the topic. The easiest is to build on top of the test merge
          commit +, and when your work in the topic branch is finally
          ready, pull the topic branch into master, and/or ask the upstream
          to pull from you. By that time, however, the master or the
          upstream might have been advanced since the test merge +, in
          which case the final commit graph would look like this:

                      $ git switch topic
                      $ git merge master
                      $ ... work on both topic and master branches
                      $ git switch master
                      $ git merge topic

                            o---*---o---+---o---o topic
                           /           /         \
                  o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master

          When your topic branch is long-lived, however, your topic branch
          would end up having many such "Merge from master" commits on it,
          which would unnecessarily clutter the development history.
          Readers of the Linux kernel mailing list may remember that Linus
          complained about such too frequent test merges when a subsystem
          maintainer asked to pull from a branch full of "useless merges".

          As an alternative, to keep the topic branch clean of test merges,
          you could blow away the test merge, and keep building on top of
          the tip before the test merge:

                      $ git switch topic
                      $ git merge master
                      $ git reset --hard HEAD^ ;# rewind the test merge
                      $ ... work on both topic and master branches
                      $ git switch master
                      $ git merge topic

                            o---*---o-------o---o topic
                           /                     \
                  o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o---+ master

          This would leave only one merge commit when your topic branch is
          finally ready and merged into the master branch. This merge would
          require you to resolve the conflict, introduced by the commits
          marked with *. However, this conflict is often the same conflict
          you resolved when you created the test merge you blew away. git
          rerere helps you resolve this final conflicted merge using the
          information from your earlier hand resolve.

          Running the git rerere command immediately after a conflicted
          automerge records the conflicted working tree files, with the
          usual conflict markers <<<<<<<, =======, and >>>>>>> in them.
          Later, after you are done resolving the conflicts, running git
          rerere again will record the resolved state of these files.
          Suppose you did this when you created the test merge of master
          into the topic branch.

          Next time, after seeing the same conflicted automerge, running
          git rerere will perform a three-way merge between the earlier
          conflicted automerge, the earlier manual resolution, and the
          current conflicted automerge. If this three-way merge resolves
          cleanly, the result is written out to your working tree file, so
          you do not have to manually resolve it. Note that git rerere
          leaves the index file alone, so you still need to do the final
          sanity checks with git diff (or git diff -c) and git add when you
          are satisfied.

          As a convenience measure, git merge automatically invokes git
          rerere upon exiting with a failed automerge and git rerere
          records the hand resolve when it is a new conflict, or reuses the
          earlier hand resolve when it is not. git commit also invokes git
          rerere when committing a merge result. What this means is that
          you do not have to do anything special yourself (besides enabling
          the rerere.enabled config variable).

          In our example, when you do the test merge, the manual resolution
          is recorded, and it will be reused when you do the actual merge
          later with the updated master and topic branch, as long as the
          recorded resolution is still applicable.

          The information git rerere records is also used when running git
          rebase. After blowing away the test merge and continuing
          development on the topic branch:

                            o---*---o-------o---o topic
                           /
                  o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master

                      $ git rebase master topic

                                                o---*---o-------o---o topic
                                               /
                  o---o---o---*---o---o---o---o   master

          you could run git rebase master topic, to bring yourself up to
          date before your topic is ready to be sent upstream. This would
          result in falling back to a three-way merge, and it would
          conflict the same way as the test merge you resolved earlier. git
          rerere will be run by git rebase to help you resolve this
          conflict.

          [NOTE] git rerere relies on the conflict markers in the file to
          detect the conflict. If the file already contains lines that look
          the same as lines with conflict markers, git rerere may fail to
          record a conflict resolution. To work around this, the
          conflict-marker-size setting in gitattributes(5) can be used.
