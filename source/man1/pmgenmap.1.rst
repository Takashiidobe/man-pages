   PMGENMAP(1)              General Commands Manual             PMGENMAP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmgenmap - generate C code to simplify handling of performance
          metrics


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmgenmap [infile]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Given one or more lists of metric names in infile or on standard
          input, pmgenmap generates C declarations and cpp(1) macros
          suitable for use across the Performance Metrics Programming
          Interface (PMAPI) on standard output.

          The declarations produced by pmgenmap simplify the coding for
          client applications using the PMAPI.

          The input should consist of one or more lists of metric names of
          the form

               listname {
                   metricname1 symbolname1
                   metricname2 symbolname2
                   ...
               }

          which will generate C and cpp(1) declarations of the form

               char *listname[] = {
               #define symbolname1 0
                   "metricname1",
               #define symbolname2 1
                   "metricname2",
                   ...
               };

          The array declarations produced are suitable as parameters to
          pmLookupName(3) and the #defined constants may be used to index
          the vsets in the pmResult structure returned by a pmFetch(3)
          call.

          Obviously, listname must conform to the C identifier naming
          rules, each symbolname must conform to the cpp(1) macro naming
          rules, and each metricname is expected to be a valid performance
          metrics name (see PMNS(5) for more details).

          The input may include sh-style comment lines, i.e. with a `#' as
          the first non-blank character of a line, and these are translated
          on output to either single line or multi-line C comments in the
          K&R style.  For example, the input:

               # leading block of multi-line comments
               # initialization group
               foo {
                       a.b.c   ONE
                       d.e.f.g TWO
                       # embedded block of multi-lines
                       # comments and boring pad text
                       xx.yy.zz        THREE
               }

               # trailing single line comment

          Produces the output:

               /*
                * leading block of multi-line comments
                * initialization group
                */
               char *foo[] = {
               #define ONE 0
                       "a.b.c",
               #define TWO 1
                       "d.e.f.g",
               /*
                * embedded block of multi-lines
                * comments and boring pad text
                */
               #define THREE 2
                       "xx.yy.zz",

               };

               /* trailing single line comment */


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          For brevity we have removed the error handling code, and assumed
          the chosen metrics do not have multiple values.

          The input file

               mystats {
                   kernel.percpu.cpu.idle     IDLE
                   kernel.percpu.cpu.sys      SYS
                   kernel.percpu.cpu.user     USER
                   hinv.ncpu                       NCPU
               }

          produces the following C code, suitable for #include-ing

               /*
                * Performance Metrics Name Space Map
                * Built by pmgenmap from the file
                * mystats.metrics
                * on Wed Dec 28 19:44:17 EST 1994
                *
                * Do not edit this file!
                */

               char *mystats[] = {
               #define IDLE    0
                       "kernel.percpu.cpu.idle",
               #define SYS     1
                       "kernel.percpu.cpu.sys",
               #define USER    2
                       "kernel.percpu.cpu.user",
               #define NCPU    3
                       "hinv.ncpu",

               };

          Using the code generated by pmgenmap, we are now able to easily
          obtain metrics from the Performance Metrics Collection Subsystem
          (PMCS) as follows:

               #define MAX_PMID 4

                   int         trip = 0;
                   int         numpmid = sizeof(mystats)/sizeof(mystats[0]);
                   double      duration;
                   pmResult    *resp;
                   pmResult    *prev;
                   pmID        pmidlist[MAX_PMID];

                   pmNewContext(PM_CONTEXT_HOST, "localhost");
                   pmLookupName(numpmid, mystats, pmidlist);
                   pmFetch(numpmid, pmidlist, &resp);

                   printf("%d CPUs: %d usr   %d sys   %d   idle0,
                          resp->vset[NCPU]->vlist[0].value.lval,
                          resp->vset[USER]->vlist[0].value.lval,
                          resp->vset[SYS]->vlist[0].value.lval,
                          resp->vset[IDLE]->vlist[0].value.lval);

          Some calls to ensure portability have been removed from the code
          above for the sake of clarity - the example above should not be
          used as a template for programming.  In particular, the raw
          values of the metrics were used when pmLookupDesc(3) should have
          been called to determine the semantics of each metric.

          More complete examples that demonstrate the use of pmgenmap which
          may be used as a basis for program development are included in
          the PCP demos, e.g.  $PCP_DEMOS_DIR/pmclient.

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
