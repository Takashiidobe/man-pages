NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          cmtime - RDMA CM connection steps timing test.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          cmtime [-s server_address] [-b bind_address]
                         [-c connections] [-p port_number]
                         [-r retries] [-t timeout_ms]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Determines min and max times for various "steps" in RDMA CM
          connection setup and teardown between a client and server
          application.

          "Steps" that are timed are: create id, bind address, resolve
          address, resolve route, create qp, connect, disconnect, and
          destroy.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -s server_address
                 The network name or IP address of the server system
                 listening for connections.  The used name or address must
                 route over an RDMA device.  This option must be specified
                 by the client.

          -b bind_address
                 The local network address to bind to.

          -c connections
                 The number of connections to establish between the client
                 and server.  (default 100)

          -p port_number
                 The server's port number.

          -r retries
                 Number of retries when resolving address or route.
                 (default 2)

          -t timeout_ms
                 Timeout in millseconds (ms) when resolving address or
                 route.  (default 2000 - 2 seconds)


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Basic usage is to start cmtime on a server system, then run
          cmtime -s server_name on a client system.

          Because this test maps RDMA resources to userspace, users must
          ensure that they have available system resources and permissions.
          See the libibverbs README file for additional details.
