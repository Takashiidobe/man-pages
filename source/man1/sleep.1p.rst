   SLEEP(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              SLEEP(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sleep — suspend execution for an interval


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          sleep time


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sleep utility shall suspend execution for at least the
          integral number of seconds specified by the time operand.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          time      A non-negative decimal integer specifying the number of
                    seconds for which to suspend execution.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          sleep:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If the sleep utility receives a SIGALRM signal, one of the
          following actions shall be taken:

           1. Terminate normally with a zero exit status.

           2. Effectively ignore the signal.

           3. Provide the default behavior for signals described in the
              ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section of Section 1.4, Utility
              Description Defaults.  This could include terminating with a
              non-zero exit status.

          The sleep utility shall take the standard action for all other
          signals.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    The execution was successfully suspended for at least time
                seconds, or a SIGALRM signal was received. See the
                ASYNCHRONOUS EVENTS section.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sleep utility can be used to execute a command after a
          certain amount of time, as in:

              (sleep 105; command) &

          or to execute a command every so often, as in:

              while true
              do
                  command
                  sleep 37
              done


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The exit status is allowed to be zero when sleep is interrupted
          by the SIGALRM signal because most implementations of this
          utility rely on the arrival of that signal to notify them that
          the requested finishing time has been successfully attained. Such
          implementations thus do not distinguish this situation from the
          successful completion case. Other implementations are allowed to
          catch the signal and go back to sleep until the requested time
          expires or to provide the normal signal termination procedures.

          As with all other utilities that take integral operands and do
          not specify subranges of allowed values, sleep is required by
          this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to deal with time requests of up to
          2147483647 seconds. This may mean that some implementations have
          to make multiple calls to the delay mechanism of the underlying
          operating system if its argument range is less than this.

          None.
