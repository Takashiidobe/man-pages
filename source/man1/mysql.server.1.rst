   MYSQL.SERVER(1)          MariaDB Database System         MYSQL.SERVER(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql.server - MariaDB server startup script


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql {start|stop}


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          MariaDB distributions on Unix include a script named
          mysql.server. It can be used on systems such as Linux and Solaris
          that use System V-style run directories to start and stop system
          services. It is also used by the Mac OS X Startup Item for
          MariaDB.

          mysql.server can be found in the support-files directory under
          your MariaDB installation directory or in a MariaDB source
          distribution.

          If you use the Linux server RPM package
          (MySQL-server-VERSION.rpm), the mysql.server script will be
          installed in the /etc/init.d directory with the name mysql. You
          need not install it manually.

          Some vendors provide RPM packages that install a startup script
          under a different name such as mysqld.

          If you install MariaDB from a source distribution or using a
          binary distribution format that does not install mysql.server
          automatically, you can install it manually.

          mysql.server reads options from the [mysql.server] and [mysqld]
          sections of option files. For backward compatibility, it also
          reads [mysql_server] sections, although you should rename such
          sections to [mysql.server]&.

          mysql.server supports the following options.

          •   --basedir=path

              The path to the MariaDB installation directory.

          •   --datadir=path

              The path to the MariaDB data directory.

          •   --pid-file=file_name

              The path name of the file in which the server should write
              its process ID. If not provided, the default, "host_name.pid"
              is used.

          •   --service-startup-timeout=file_name

              How long in seconds to wait for confirmation of server
              startup. If the server does not start within this time,
              mysql.server exits with an error. The default value is 900. A
              value of 0 means not to wait at all for startup. Negative
              values mean to wait forever (no timeout).

          •   --use-mysqld_safe

              Use mysqld_safe to start the server. This is the default.

          •   --use-manager

              Use Instance Manager to start the server.

          •   --user=user_name

              The login user name to use for running mysqld.
