   LOGGER(1P)              POSIX Programmer's Manual             LOGGER(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          logger — log messages


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          logger string...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The logger utility saves a message, in an unspecified manner and
          format, containing the string operands provided by the user. The
          messages are expected to be evaluated later by personnel
          performing system administration tasks.

          It is implementation-defined whether messages written in locales
          other than the POSIX locale are effective.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          string    One of the string arguments whose contents are
                    concatenated together, in the order specified,
                    separated by single <space> characters.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          logger:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error. (This means diagnostics from logger to
                    the user or application, not diagnostic messages that
                    the user is sending to the system administrator.)

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Unspecified.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This utility allows logging of information for later use by a
          system administrator or programmer in determining why non-
          interactive utilities have failed. The locations of the saved
          messages, their format, and retention period are all unspecified.
          There is no method for a conforming application to read messages,
          once written.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          A batch application, running non-interactively, tries to read a
          configuration file and fails; it may attempt to notify the system
          administrator with:

              logger myname: unable to read file foo. [timestamp]


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard developers believed strongly that some method of
          alerting administrators to errors was necessary. The obvious
          example is a batch utility, running non-interactively, that is
          unable to read its configuration files or that is unable to
          create or write its results file. However, the standard
          developers did not wish to define the format or delivery
          mechanisms as they have historically been (and will probably
          continue to be) very system-specific, as well as involving
          functionality clearly outside the scope of this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017.

          The text with LC_MESSAGES about diagnostic messages means
          diagnostics from logger to the user or application, not
          diagnostic messages that the user is sending to the system
          administrator.

          Multiple string arguments are allowed, similar to echo, for ease-
          of-use.

          Like the utilities mailx and lp, logger is admittedly difficult
          to test. This was not deemed sufficient justification to exclude
          these utilities from this volume of POSIX.1‐2017. It is also
          arguable that they are, in fact, testable, but that the tests
          themselves are not portable.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          lp(1p), mailx(1p), write(1p)
