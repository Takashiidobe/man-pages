   BABELTRACE2-RUN(1)         Babeltrace 2 manual        BABELTRACE2-RUN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          babeltrace2-run - Create a Babeltrace 2 trace processing graph
          and run it


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          babeltrace2 [GENERAL OPTIONS] run [--retry-duration=TIME-US]
                      --connect=CONN-RULE... COMPONENTS


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The run command creates a Babeltrace 2 trace processing graph and
          runs it.

          See babeltrace2-intro(7) to learn more about the Babeltrace 2
          project and its core concepts.

          The run command dynamically loads Babeltrace 2 plugins which
          supply component classes. With the run command, you specify which
          component classes to instantiate as components and how to connect
          them.

          The steps to write a babeltrace2 run command line are:

           1. Specify which component classes to instantiate as components
              with many --component options and how to configure them.

              This is the COMPONENTS part of the synopsis. See “Create
              components” to learn more.

           2. Specify how to connect components together with one or more
              --connect options.

              See “Connect components” to learn more.

              Note
              The babeltrace2-convert(1) command is a specialization of the
              run command for the very common case of converting one or
              more traces: it generates a run command line and executes it.
              You can use its --run-args or --run-args-0 option to make it
              print the equivalent run command line instead.

      Create components
          To create a component, use the --component option. This option
          specifies:

          •   The name of the component, unique amongst all the component
              names of the trace processing graph.

          •   The type of the component class to instantiate: source,
              filter, or sink.

          •   The name of the plugin in which to find the component class
              to instantiate.

          •   The name of the component class to instantiate.

          Use the --component option multiple times to create multiple
          components. You can instantiate the same component class multiple
          times as different components.

          At any point in the command line, the --base-params sets the
          current base initialization parameters and the --reset-base-
          params resets them. When you specify a --component option, its
          initial initialization parameters are a copy of the current base
          initialization parameters.

          Immediately following a --component option on the command line,
          the created component is known as the current component (until
          the next --component option).

          The --params=PARAMS option adds parameters to the current
          component’s initialization parameters. If PARAMS contains a key
          which exists in the current component’s initialization
          parameters, this parameter is replaced.

      Connect components
          The components which you create from component classes with the
          --component option (see “Create components”) add input and output
          ports depending on their type. An output port is from where
          messages, like trace events, are sent. An input port is where
          messages are received. For a given component, each port has a
          unique name.

          The purpose of the run command is to create a trace processing
          graph, that is, to know which component ports to connect
          together. The command achieves this with the help of the
          connection rules that you provide with one or more
          --connect=CONN-RULE options.

          The format of CONN-RULE is:

              UP-COMP-PAT[.UP-PORT-PAT]:DOWN-COMP-PAT[.DOWN-PORT-PAT]

          UP-COMP-PAT
              Upstream component name pattern.

          UP-PORT-PAT
              Upstream (output) port name pattern.

          DOWN-COMP-PAT
              Downstream component name pattern.

          DOWN-PORT-PAT
              Downstream (input) port name pattern.

          When a source or filter component adds a new output port within
          the processing graph, the run command does the following to find
          an input port to connect it to:

              For each connection rule (--connect options, in order):
                If the output port's component's name matches UP-COMP-PAT and the
                output port's name matches UP-PORT-PAT:
                  For each component COMP in the trace processing graph:
                    If the name of COMP matches DOWN-COMP-PAT:
                      Select the first input port of COMP of which the name matches
                      DOWN-PORT-PAT, or fail with no match.

              No possible connection: fail with no match.

          UP-COMP-PAT, UP-PORT-PAT, DOWN-COMP-PAT, and DOWN-PORT-PAT are
          globbing patterns where only the wildcard character, *, is
          special: it matches zero or more characters. You must escape the
          *, ?, [, ., :, and \ characters with \.

          When you do not specify UP-PORT-PAT or DOWN-PORT-PAT, they are
          equivalent to *.

          You can leverage this connection mechanism to specify fallbacks
          with a careful use of wildcards, as the order of the --connect
          options on the command line is significant. For example:

              --connect='A.out*:B.in*' --connect=A:B --connect='*:C'

          With those connection rules, the run command connects:

          •   Any output port of which the name starts with out of
              component A to the first input port of which the name starts
              with in of component B.

          •   Any other output port of component A to the first available
              input port of component B.

          •   Any other output port (of any component except A) to the
              first available input port of component C.

          The run command fails when it cannot find an input port to which
          to connect a given output port using the provided connection
          rules.

          See “EXAMPLES” for more examples.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

      General
          You can use those options before the command name.

          See babeltrace2(1) for more details.

          -d, --debug
              Legacy option: this is equivalent to --log-level=TRACE.

          -l LVL, --log-level=LVL
              Set the log level of all known Babeltrace 2 loggers to LVL.

          --omit-home-plugin-path
              Do not search for plugins in
              $HOME/.local/lib/babeltrace2/plugins.

          --omit-system-plugin-path
              Do not search for plugins in
              /usr/local/lib/babeltrace2/plugins.

          --plugin-path=PATH[:PATH]...
              Add PATH to the list of paths in which plugins can be found.

          -v, --verbose
              Legacy option: this is equivalent to --log-level=INFO.

      Component creation
          See “Create components” for more details.

          -b PARAMS, --base-params=PARAMS
              Set the current base parameters to PARAMS.

              You can reset the current base parameters with the --reset-
              base-params option.

              See the --params option for the format of PARAMS.

          -c NAME:COMP-CLS-TYPE.PLUGIN-NAME.COMP-CLS-NAME,
          --component=NAME:COMP-CLS-TYPE.PLUGIN-NAME.COMP-CLS-NAME
              Create a component named NAME from the component class of
              type COMP-CLS-TYPE named COMP-CLS-NAME found in the plugin
              named PLUGIN-NAME, and set it as the current component.

              The available values for TYPE are:

              source, src
                  Source component class.

              filter, flt
                  Filter component class.

              sink
                  Sink component class.

              The initial initialization parameters of this component are
              copied from the current base initialization parameters (see
              the --base-params option).

          -l LVL, --log-level=LVL
              Set the log level of the current component to LVL.

              The available values for LVL are:

              NONE, N
                  Logging is disabled.

              FATAL, F
                  Severe errors that lead the execution to abort
                  immediately.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              ERROR, E
                  Errors that might still allow the execution to continue.

                  Usually, once one or more errors are reported at this
                  level, the application, plugin, or library won’t perform
                  any more useful task, but it should still exit cleanly.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              WARN, WARNING, W
                  Unexpected situations which still allow the execution to
                  continue.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              INFO, I
                  Informational messages that highlight progress or
                  important states of the application, plugins, or library.

                  This level can be enabled in production.

              DEBUG, D
                  Debugging information, with a higher level of details
                  than the TRACE level.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

              TRACE, T
                  Low-level debugging context information.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

          -p PARAMS, --params=PARAMS
              Add PARAMS to the initialization parameters of the current
              component.

              If PARAMS contains a key which exists in the current
              component’s initialization parameters, replace the parameter.

              The format of PARAMS is a comma-separated list of NAME=VALUE
              assignments:

                  NAME=VALUE[,NAME=VALUE]...

              NAME
                  Parameter name (C identifier plus the :, ., and -
                  characters).

              VALUE
                  One of:

                  •   null, nul, NULL: null value.

                  •   true, TRUE, yes, YES: true boolean value.

                  •   false, FALSE, no, NO: false boolean value.

                  •   Binary (0b prefix), octal (0 prefix), decimal, or
                      hexadecimal (0x prefix) unsigned (with + prefix) or
                      signed 64-bit integer.

                  •   Double precision floating point number (scientific
                      notation is accepted).

                  •   Unquoted string with no special characters, and not
                      matching any of the null and boolean value symbols
                      above.

                  •   Double-quoted string (accepts escape characters).

                  •   Array, formatted as an opening [, a comma-separated
                      list of VALUE, and a closing ].

                  •   Map, formatted as an opening {, a comma-separated
                      list of NAME=VALUE assignments, and a closing }.

                  You may put whitespaces around the individual =
                  (assignment), , (separator), [ (array beginning), ]
                  (array end), { (map beginning), and } (map end)
                  characters.

              Example:

                  --params='many=null, fresh=yes, condition=false, squirrel=-782329,
                            play=+23, observe=3.14, simple=beef,
                            needs-quotes="some string",
                            escape.chars-are:allowed="a \" quote",
                            things=[1, "hello", 2.71828],
                            frog={slow=2, bath=[bike, 23], blind=NO}'

                  Important
                  Like in the example above, make sure to single-quote the
                  whole argument when you run this command from a shell, as
                  it can contain many special characters.

          -r, --reset-base-params
              Reset the current base parameters.

              You can set the current base parameters with the --base-
              params option.

      Component connection
          -x CONN-RULE, --connect=CONN-RULE
              Add the connection rule CONN-RULE.

              The format of CONN-RULE is:

                  UP-COMP-PAT[.UP-PORT-PAT]:DOWN-COMP-PAT[.DOWN-PORT-PAT]

              UP-COMP-PAT
                  Upstream component name pattern.

              UP-PORT-PAT
                  Upstream (output) port name pattern.

              DOWN-COMP-PAT
                  Downstream component name pattern.

              DOWN-PORT-PAT
                  Downstream (input) port name pattern.

              See “Connect components” to learn more.

      Graph configuration
          --retry-duration=TIME-US
              Set the duration of a single retry to TIME-US µs when a sink
              component reports "try again later" (busy network or file
              system, for example).

              Default: 100000 (100 ms).

      Command information
          -h, --help
              Show the command’s help and quit.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Example 1. Create a single-port source component and a
          single-port sink component and connect them.

              $ babeltrace2 run --component=A:src.plug.my-src \
                                --component=B:sink.plug.my-sink \
                                --connect=A:B

          Possible resulting graph:

              +-----------------+    +-------------------+
              | src.plug.my-src |    | sink.plug.my-sink |
              |       [A]       |    |         [B]       |
              |                 |    |                   |
              |             out @--->@ in                |
              +-----------------+    +-------------------+

          Example 2. Use the --params option to set the current component’s
          initialization parameters.

          In this example, the --params option only applies to component
          the-source.

              $ babeltrace2 run --component=the-source:src.my-plugin.my-src \
                                --params=offset=123,flag=true \
                                --component=the-sink:sink.my-plugin.my-sink \
                                --connect=the-source:the-sink

          Example 3. Use the --base-params and --reset-base-params options
          to set and reset the current base initialization parameters.

          In this example, the effective initialization parameters of the
          created components are:

          Component A
              offset=1203, flag=false

          Component B
              offset=1203, flag=true, type=event

          Component C
              ratio=0.25

              $ babeltrace2 run --base-params=offset=1203,flag=false \
                                --component=A:src.plugin.compcls \
                                --component=B:flt.plugin.compcls \
                                --params=flag=true,type=event \
                                --reset-base-params \

                                --connect=A:B --connect=B:C

          Example 4. Specify a component connection fallback rule.

          In this example, any A output port of which the name starts with
          foo is connected to a B input port of which the name starts with
          nin. Any other A output port is connected to a B input port of
          which the name starts with oth.

          The order of the --connect options is important here: the
          opposite order would create a system in which the first rule is
          always satisfied, and any A output port, whatever its name, would
          be connected to a B input port with a name that starts with oth.

              $ babeltrace2 run --component=A:src.plug.my-src \
                                --component=B:sink.plug.my-sink \
                                --connect='A.foo*:B:nin*' --connect='A:B.oth*'

          Possible resulting graph:

::

      Babeltrace 2 library
          BABELTRACE_EXEC_ON_ABORT=CMDLINE
              Execute the command line CMDLINE, as parsed like a UNIX 98
              shell, when any part of the Babeltrace 2 project unexpectedly
              aborts.

              The application only aborts when the executed command
              returns, ignoring its exit status.

              This environment variable is ignored when the application has
              the setuid or the setgid access right flag set.

          BABELTRACE_TERM_COLOR=(AUTO | NEVER | ALWAYS)
              Force the terminal color support for the babeltrace2(1)
              program and the project’s plugins.

              The available values are:

              AUTO
                  Only emit terminal color codes when the standard output
                  and error streams are connected to a color-capable
                  terminal.

              NEVER
                  Never emit terminal color codes.

              ALWAYS
                  Always emit terminal color codes.

          BABELTRACE_TERM_COLOR_BRIGHT_MEANS_BOLD=0
              Set to 0 to emit SGR (see
              <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>) codes 90 to
              97 for bright colors instead of bold (SGR code 1) and
              standard color codes (SGR codes 30 to 37).

          BABELTRACE_PLUGIN_PATH=PATHS
              Set the list of directories, in order, in which dynamic
              plugins can be found before other directories are considered
              to PATHS (colon-separated, or semicolon on Windows).

          LIBBABELTRACE2_DISABLE_PYTHON_PLUGINS=1
              Disable the loading of any Babeltrace 2 Python plugin.

          LIBBABELTRACE2_INIT_LOG_LEVEL=LVL
              Force the Babeltrace 2 library’s initial log level to be LVL.

              If this environment variable is set, it overrides the log
              level set by the --log-level option for the Babeltrace 2
              library logger.

              The available values for LVL are:

              NONE, N
                  Logging is disabled.

              FATAL, F
                  Severe errors that lead the execution to abort
                  immediately.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              ERROR, E
                  Errors that might still allow the execution to continue.

                  Usually, once one or more errors are reported at this
                  level, the application, plugin, or library won’t perform
                  any more useful task, but it should still exit cleanly.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              WARN, WARNING, W
                  Unexpected situations which still allow the execution to
                  continue.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              INFO, I
                  Informational messages that highlight progress or
                  important states of the application, plugins, or library.

                  This level can be enabled in production.

              DEBUG, D
                  Debugging information, with a higher level of details
                  than the TRACE level.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

              TRACE, T
                  Low-level debugging context information.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

          LIBBABELTRACE2_NO_DLCLOSE=1
              Make the Babeltrace 2 library leave any dynamically loaded
              modules (plugins and plugin providers) open at exit. This can
              be useful for debugging purposes.

          LIBBABELTRACE2_PLUGIN_PROVIDER_DIR=DIR
              Set the directory from which the Babeltrace 2 library
              dynamically loads plugin provider shared objects to DIR.

              If this environment variable is set, it overrides the default
              plugin provider directory.

      Babeltrace 2 Python bindings
          BABELTRACE_PYTHON_BT2_LOG_LEVEL=LVL
              Force the Babeltrace 2 Python bindings log level to be LVL.

              If this environment variable is set, it overrides the log
              level set by the --log-level option for the Python bindings
              logger.

              The available values for LVL are:

              NONE, N
                  Logging is disabled.

              FATAL, F
                  Severe errors that lead the execution to abort
                  immediately.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              ERROR, E
                  Errors that might still allow the execution to continue.

                  Usually, once one or more errors are reported at this
                  level, the application, plugin, or library won’t perform
                  any more useful task, but it should still exit cleanly.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              WARN, WARNING, W
                  Unexpected situations which still allow the execution to
                  continue.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              INFO, I
                  Informational messages that highlight progress or
                  important states of the application, plugins, or library.

                  This level can be enabled in production.

              DEBUG, D
                  Debugging information, with a higher level of details
                  than the TRACE level.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

              TRACE, T
                  Low-level debugging context information.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

      CLI
          BABELTRACE_CLI_LOG_LEVEL=LVL
              Force babeltrace2 CLI’s log level to be LVL.

              If this environment variable is set, it overrides the log
              level set by the --log-level option for the CLI logger.

              The available values for LVL are:

              NONE, N
                  Logging is disabled.

              FATAL, F
                  Severe errors that lead the execution to abort
                  immediately.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              ERROR, E
                  Errors that might still allow the execution to continue.

                  Usually, once one or more errors are reported at this
                  level, the application, plugin, or library won’t perform
                  any more useful task, but it should still exit cleanly.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              WARN, WARNING, W
                  Unexpected situations which still allow the execution to
                  continue.

                  This level should be enabled in production.

              INFO, I
                  Informational messages that highlight progress or
                  important states of the application, plugins, or library.

                  This level can be enabled in production.

              DEBUG, D
                  Debugging information, with a higher level of details
                  than the TRACE level.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

              TRACE, T
                  Low-level debugging context information.

                  This level should NOT be enabled in production.

          BABELTRACE_CLI_WARN_COMMAND_NAME_DIRECTORY_CLASH=0
              Disable the warning message which babeltrace2-convert(1)
              prints when you convert a trace with a relative path that’s
              also the name of a babeltrace2 command.

          BABELTRACE_DEBUG=1
              Legacy variable: equivalent to setting the --log-level option
              to TRACE.

          BABELTRACE_VERBOSE=1
              Legacy variable: equivalent to setting the --log-level option
              to INFO.
