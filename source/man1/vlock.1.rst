   VLOCK(1)                 General Commands Manual                VLOCK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          vlock - Virtual Console lock program


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          vlock

          vlock [ -a,--all ] [ -c,--current ] [ -h,--help ] [ -v,--version
          ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          vlock is a program to lock one or more sessions on the Linux
          console.  This is especially useful for Linux machines which have
          multiple users with access to the console.  One user may lock his
          or her session(s) while still allowing other users to use the
          system on other virtual consoles.  If desired, the entire console
          may be locked and virtual console switching disabled.

          By default, only the current VC (virtual console) is locked.
          With the -a,-all option all VCs are locked.  The locked VCs
          cannot be unlocked without the invoker's password.  And, for the
          paranoid, vlock makes it a trying experience for those attempting
          to guess the password, so unauthorized access to session(s) is
          highly unlikely.

          Please note that it is entirely possible to completely lock
          yourself out of the console with the -a,--all option if you
          cannot remember your password!  Unless you are able to kill vlock
          by logging in remotely via a serial terminal or network, a hard
          reset is the only method of ``unlocking'' the display.

          vlock works for console sessions primarily.  However, there is
          support for trying to lock non-console sessions as well, but that
          support has not been well tested.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -a,--all

                 Lock all console sessions and disable VC switching.

          -c,--current

                 Lock the current session (this is the default).

          -h,--help

                 Print a brief help message.

          -v,--version

                 Print the version number of vlock.
