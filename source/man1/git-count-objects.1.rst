NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-count-objects - Count unpacked number of objects and their
          disk consumption


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git count-objects [-v] [-H | --human-readable]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This counts the number of unpacked object files and disk space
          consumed by them, to help you decide when it is a good time to
          repack.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -v, --verbose
              Report in more detail:

              count: the number of loose objects

              size: disk space consumed by loose objects, in KiB (unless -H
              is specified)

              in-pack: the number of in-pack objects

              size-pack: disk space consumed by the packs, in KiB (unless
              -H is specified)

              prune-packable: the number of loose objects that are also
              present in the packs. These objects could be pruned using git
              prune-packed.

              garbage: the number of files in object database that are
              neither valid loose objects nor valid packs

              size-garbage: disk space consumed by garbage files, in KiB
              (unless -H is specified)

              alternate: absolute path of alternate object databases; may
              appear multiple times, one line per path. Note that if the
              path contains non-printable characters, it may be surrounded
              by double-quotes and contain C-style backslashed escape
              sequences.

          -H, --human-readable
              Print sizes in human readable format
