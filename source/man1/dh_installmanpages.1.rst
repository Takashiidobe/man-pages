   DH_INSTALLMANPAGES(1)           Debhelper          DH_INSTALLMANPAGES(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installmanpages - old-style man page installer (deprecated)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installmanpages [debhelper options] [file ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installmanpages is a debhelper program that is responsible for
          automatically installing man pages into usr/share/man/ in package
          build directories.

          This is a DWIM-style program, with an interface unlike the rest
          of debhelper. It is deprecated, and you are encouraged to use
          dh_installman(1) instead.

          dh_installmanpages scans the current directory and all
          subdirectories for filenames that look like man pages. (Note that
          only real files are looked at; symlinks are ignored.) It uses
          file(1) to verify that the files are in the correct format. Then,
          based on the files' extensions, it installs them into the correct
          man directory.

          All filenames specified as parameters will be skipped by
          dh_installmanpages.  This is useful if by default it installs
          some man pages that you do not want to be installed.

          After the man page installation step, dh_installmanpages will
          check to see if any of the man pages are .so links. If so, it
          changes them to symlinks.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          file ...
              Do not install these files as man pages, even if they look
              like valid man pages.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_installmanpages will install the man pages it finds into all
          packages you tell it to act on, since it can't tell what package
          the man pages belong in. This is almost never what you really
          want (use -p to work around this, or use the much better
          dh_installman(1) program instead).

          Files ending in .man will be ignored.

          Files specified as parameters that contain spaces in their
          filenames will not be processed properly.
