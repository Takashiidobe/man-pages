   PMLOGGER_REWRITE(1)      General Commands Manual     PMLOGGER_REWRITE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogger_rewrite - helper script to rewrite Performance Co-Pilot
          archives


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmlogger_rewrite [-dNsVvw?]  [-c config] archive
          ...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogger_rewrite is a helper script that is used by
          pmlogger_daily(1) when rewriting Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
          archives.  Rewriting is usually required to accommodate
          evolutionary changes in metadata so old archives can be updated
          and then merged with current archives.

          pmlogger_rewrite is a wrapper script for pmlogrewrite(1) that
          will potentially rewrite all of the archive logs matching the
          archive arguments.  Each archive argument may be a PCP archive
          file name, the basename for the files in a PCP archive, or a
          directory (in which case all subordinate PCP archives are found
          by recursive descent).

          pmlogrewrite is run with the -i option so rewriting is done ``in
          place''.  The -q option is also used, so if no rewriting is
          required then no changes are made to the archive files.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following options are passed through to pmlogrewrite: -c (or
          --config), -d (or --desperate), -s (or --scale), -v (or
          --verbose) and -w (or --warnings).  Refer to pmlogrewrite(1) for
          the meaning of these options.

          The remaining options are:

          -N, --showme
               Runs pmlogger_rewrite in a ``show me'' or ``dry run'' mode
               where the tasks that would be performed are reported, but no
               changes are made.  This is typically used for debugging in
               combination with one (verbose) or two (very verbose) -V
               options.

          -V, --verbose
               Increase script output verbosity.

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
