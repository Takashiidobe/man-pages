NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmsocks - shell wrapper for performance monitoring across
          firewalls


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmsocks path [args ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmsocks allows Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) clients running on
          hosts located on the internal side of a TCP/IP firewall to
          monitor remote hosts on the other side of the firewall.  This
          assumes the firewall has been configured with a compliant sockd
          daemon and the necessary access controls are satisfied.

          pmsocks is a thin shell wrapper around the tsocks(8) library
          using the tsocks(1) utility, which are not included with PCP.
          You can obtain tsocks from https://tsocks.sourceforge.net/ .

          /etc/tsocks.conf
               configuration file for the tsocks(8) library.
