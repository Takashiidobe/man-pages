   PMDALIO(1)               General Commands Manual              PMDALIO(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdalio - Linux LIO subsystem PMDA


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdalio is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          exports metric values about the Linux I/O target subsystem, which
          provides for protocols like iSCSI, FCP, FCoE.  These allow
          storage available on one host to be exported and consumed by
          other hosts using industry standard protocols.

          This PMDA exports summary metrics which are performance value
          aggregations and configuration per LIO target instance.
          Additionally, it provides per LUN performance metrics including
          IOPS, and READ and WRITE throughput.

          The LIO configuration is maintained within the kernel's configfs
          virtual filesystem.  The python-rtslib module provides an
          interface to configfs, allowing tools like pmdalio to interact
          with the settings and metadata held in configfs.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Install the lio PMDA by using the Install script as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
              # ./Install

          To uninstall, do the following as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio
              # ./Remove

          pmdalio is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Install
              installation script for the pmdalio agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/lio/Remove
              undo installation script for the pmdalio agent

          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/lio.log
              default log file for error messages from pmdalio


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
