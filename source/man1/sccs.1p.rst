   SCCS(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               SCCS(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sccs — front end for the SCCS subsystem (DEVELOPMENT)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          sccs [-r] [-d path] [-p path] command [options...] [operands...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sccs utility is a front end to the SCCS programs. It also
          includes the capability to run set-user-id to another user to
          provide additional protection.

          The sccs utility shall invoke the specified command with the
          specified options and operands.  By default, each of the operands
          shall be modified by prefixing it with the string "SCCS/s.".

          The command can be the name of one of the SCCS utilities in this
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 (admin, delta, get, prs, rmdel, sact,
          unget, val, or what) or one of the pseudo-utilities listed in the
          EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sccs utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
          that options operands are actually options to be passed to the
          utility named by command.  When the portion of the command:

              command [options ... ] [operands ... ]

          is considered, all of the pseudo-utilities used as command shall
          support the Utility Syntax Guidelines. Any of the other SCCS
          utilities that can be invoked in this manner support the
          Guidelines to the extent indicated by their individual OPTIONS
          sections.

          The following options shall be supported preceding the command
          operand:

          -d path   A pathname of a directory to be used as a root
                    directory for the SCCS files. The default shall be the
                    current directory. The -d option shall take precedence
                    over the PROJECTDIR variable. See -p.

          -p path   A pathname of a directory in which the SCCS files are
                    located. The default shall be the SCCS directory.

                    The -p option differs from the -d option in that the -d
                    option-argument shall be prefixed to the entire
                    pathname and the -p option-argument shall be inserted
                    before the final component of the pathname. For
                    example:

                        sccs -d /x -p y get a/b

                    converts to:

                        get /x/a/y/s.b

                    This allows the creation of aliases such as:

                        alias syssccs="sccs -d /usr/src"

                    which is used as:

                        syssccs get cmd/who.c

          -r        Invoke command with the real user ID of the process,
                    not any effective user ID that the sccs utility is set
                    to. Certain commands (admin, check, clean, diffs, info,
                    rmdel, and tell) cannot be run set-user-ID by all
                    users, since this would allow anyone to change the
                    authorizations. These commands are always run as the
                    real user.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operands shall be supported:

          command   An SCCS utility name or the name of one of the pseudo-
                    utilities listed in the EXTENDED DESCRIPTION section.

          options   An option or option-argument to be passed to command.

          operands  An operand to be passed to command.

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          sccs:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments and input files).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.

          PROJECTDIR
                    Provide a default value for the -d path option. If the
                    value of PROJECTDIR begins with a <slash>, it shall be
                    considered an absolute pathname; otherwise, the value
                    of PROJECTDIR is treated as a user name and that user's
                    initial working directory shall be examined for a
                    subdirectory src or source.  If such a directory is
                    found, it shall be used. Otherwise, the value shall be
                    used as a relative pathname.

          Additional environment variable effects may be found in the
          utility description for the specified command.

          The following pseudo-utilities shall be supported as command
          operands. All options referred to in the following list are
          values given in the options operands following command.

          check   Equivalent to info, except that nothing shall be printed
                  if nothing is being edited, and a non-zero exit status
                  shall be returned if anything is being edited. The intent
                  is to have this included in an ``install'' entry in a
                  makefile to ensure that everything is included into the
                  SCCS file before a version is installed.

          clean   Remove everything from the current directory that can be
                  recreated from SCCS files, but do not remove any files
                  being edited. If the -b option is given, branches shall
                  be ignored in the determination of whether they are being
                  edited; this is dangerous if branches are kept in the
                  same directory.

          create  Create an SCCS file, taking the initial contents from the
                  file of the same name. Any options to admin are accepted.
                  If the creation is successful, the original files shall
                  be renamed by prefixing the basenames with a comma. These
                  renamed files should be removed after it has been
                  verified that the SCCS files have been created
                  successfully.

          delget  Perform a delta on the named files and then get new
                  versions. The new versions shall have ID keywords
                  expanded and shall not be editable. Any -m, -p, -r, -s,
                  and -y options shall be passed to delta, and any -b, -c,
                  -e, -i, -k, -l, -s, and -x options shall be passed to
                  get.

          deledit Equivalent to delget, except that the get phase shall
                  include the -e option. This option is useful for making a
                  checkpoint of the current editing phase. The same options
                  shall be passed to delta as described above, and all the
                  options listed for get above except -e shall be passed to
                  edit.

          diffs   Write a difference listing between the current version of
                  the files checked out for editing and the versions in
                  SCCS format. Any -r, -c, -i, -x, and -t options shall be
                  passed to get; any -l, -s, -e, -f, -h, and -b options
                  shall be passed to diff.  A -C option shall be passed to
                  diff as -c.

          edit    Equivalent to get -e.

          fix     Remove the named delta, but leave a copy of the delta
                  with the changes that were in it. It is useful for fixing
                  small compiler bugs, and so on. The application shall
                  ensure that it is followed by a -r SID option. Since fix
                  does not leave audit trails, it should be used carefully.

          info    Write a listing of all files being edited. If the -b
                  option is given, branches (that is, SIDs with two or
                  fewer components) shall be ignored. If a -u user option
                  is given, then only files being edited by the named user
                  shall be listed. A -U option shall be equivalent to
                  -u<current user>.

          print   Write out verbose information about the named files,
                  equivalent to sccs prs.

          tell    Write a <newline>-separated list of the files being
                  edited to standard output. Takes the -b, -u, and -U
                  options like info and check.

          unedit  This is the opposite of an edit or a get -e.  It should
                  be used with caution, since any changes made since the
                  get are lost.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Many of the SCCS utilities take directory names as operands as
          well as specific filenames. The pseudo-utilities supported by
          sccs are not described as having this capability, but are not
          prohibited from doing so.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

           1. To get a file for editing, edit it and produce a new delta:

                  sccs get -e file.c
                  ex file.c
                  sccs delta file.c

           2. To get a file from another directory:

                  sccs -p /usr/src/sccs/s. get cc.c

              or:

                  sccs get /usr/src/sccs/s.cc.c

           3. To make a delta of a large number of files in the current
              directory:

                  sccs delta *.c

           4. To get a list of files being edited that are not on branches:

                  sccs info -b

           5. To delta everything being edited by the current user:

                  sccs delta $(sccs tell -U)

           6. In a makefile, to get source files from an SCCS file if it
              does not already exist:

                  SRCS = <list of source files>
                  $(SRCS):
                      sccs get $(REL) $@


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          sccs and its associated utilities are part of the XSI Development
          Utilities option within the XSI option.

          SCCS is an abbreviation for Source Code Control System. It is a
          maintenance and enhancement tracking tool. When a file is put
          under SCCS, the source code control system maintains the file
          and, when changes are made, identifies and stores them in the
          file with the original source code and/or documentation. As other
          changes are made, they too are identified and retained in the
          file.

          Retrieval of the original and any set of changes is possible. Any
          version of the file as it develops can be reconstructed for
          inspection or additional modification. History data can be stored
          with each version, documenting why the changes were made, who
          made them, and when they were made.
