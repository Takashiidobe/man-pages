   PMDAZSWAP(1)             General Commands Manual            PMDAZSWAP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdazswap - zswap (compressed swap) PMDA


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdazswap is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          exports metric values about compressed swap operation, as tracked
          by the zswap Linux kernel module.

          Zswap is a lightweight compressed cache for swap pages.  It takes
          pages that are in the process of being swapped out and attempts
          to compress them into a dynamically allocated RAM-based memory
          pool.  Zswap trades CPU cycles for potentially reduced swap I/O.
          This tradeoff can also result in a performance improvement if
          reads from the compressed cache are faster than reads from a swap
          device.

          This PMDA exports metrics about pool size, number of pages
          stored, and various counters for the reasons pages are rejected.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Install the zswap PMDA by using the Install script as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap
              # ./Install

          To uninstall, do the following as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap
              # ./Remove

          pmdazswap is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap/Install
              installation script for the pmdazswap agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zswap/Remove
              undo installation script for the pmdazswap agent

          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/zswap.log
              default log file for error messages from pmdazswap


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
