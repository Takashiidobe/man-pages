NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-series - track changes to a patch series with git


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git series [SUBCOMMAND] [OPTIONS]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          git series tracks changes to a patch series over time.  git
          series also tracks a cover letter for the patch series, formats
          the series for email, and prepares pull requests.

          Use git series start seriesname to start a patch series
          seriesname.  Use normal git commands to commit changes, and use
          git series status to check what has changed.  Use git series
          cover to add or edit a cover letter.  Use git series add and git
          series commit (or git series commit -a) to commit changes to the
          patch series.  Use git series rebase -i to help rework or
          reorganize the patch series.  Use git series format to prepare
          the patch series to send via email, or git series req to prepare
          a "please pull" mail.

          Running git series without arguments shows the list of patch
          series, marking the current patch series with a '*'.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          git series add change...
                 Add changes to the staging area for the next git series
                 commit.

                 change...
                        Changes to add: any combination of "series",
                        "base", and "cover".

          git series base [-d|--delete] [base]
                 Get or set the base commit for the patch series.  With no
                 parameters, print the hash of the base commit.  With
                 parameters, set or delete the base commit.

                 This only changes the base in the working version of the
                 patch series; use git series add base to add that change
                 to the next git series commit, or use git series commit -a
                 to commit the new base and all other changes to the series
                 in one step.

                 base   New base commit.  This can use a commit hash, ref
                        name, or special syntaxes such as refname^ or
                        refname~2.

                 -d|--delete
                        Delete the current base commit.

          git series checkout name
                 Resume work on the patch series name; check out the
                 current version as HEAD.

          git series commit [-a|--all] [-m message] [-v|--verbose]
                 Record a new version of the patch series.  Without
                 arguments, this will run an editor to edit a commit
                 message, and then commit the changes previously added with
                 git series add.

                 -a|--all
                        Commit all changes, not just those added with git
                        series add.

                 -m message
                        Use message as the commit message, rather than
                        running an editor.

                 -v|--verbose
                        Show a diff of the commit in the editor, below the
                        commit message, as a reminder of the changes in the
                        commit.  This diff will not appear in the commit
                        message.

          git series cover [-d|--delete]
                 Create or edit the cover letter for the patch series.
                 Without arguments, this will run an editor to edit the
                 cover letter.

                 This only changes the cover letter in the working version
                 of the patch series; use git series add cover to add that
                 change to the next git series commit, or use git series
                 commit -a to commit the new cover letter and all other
                 changes to the series in one step.

                 -d|--delete
                        Delete the cover letter rather than editing it.

          git series cp [source] dest
                 Copy the series source to dest, including any work in
                 progress, staged or unstaged.  source defaults to the
                 current series if omitted.

          git series delete name
                 Delete the series name, including any work in progress,
                 staged or unstaged.

          git series detach
                 Stop working on any patch series.  Any changes in
                 progress, staged or unstaged, will remain intact.  To
                 start working on the branch again, use git series
                 checkout.

          git series diff
                 Show changes to the patch series from the current working
                 version to the staged version.  Changes to the cover
                 letter appear as standard text diffs.  If both the old and
                 new version contain base and series entries, git series
                 diff will find and show the correspondence between the old
                 and new versions of each commit.  The series diff format
                 shows reordered commits, deleted or added commits, and
                 modified commits.  For modified commits, the series diff
                 includes a simplified interdiff between the commits.

          git series format [--in-reply-to=Message-Id] [--no-from] [-v N |
          --reroll-count=N] [--rfc] [--stdout] [--subject-prefix=prefix]
                 Prepare the patch series to send via email.  This creates
                 one file per patch in the series, plus one additional file
                 for the cover letter if any.  The patch series must have a
                 base set with git series base, to identify the series of
                 patches to format.

                 Each file contains one email in mbox format, ready to
                 send, with email headers threading all the patches
                 together.  If the series has a cover letter, all of the
                 patches will include headers to make them a reply to the
                 cover letter; otherwise, all of the patches will include
                 headers to make them a reply to the first patch.

                 --in-reply-to=Message-Id
                        Make the first mail a reply to the specified
                        Message-Id.  The Message-Id may include or omit the
                        surrounding angle brackets; git-series will add
                        them if not present.

                 --no-from
                        By default, git series format includes a "From:"
                        line in the mail body for the commit author when
                        formatting commits you didn't write; this allows
                        you to send the patches as emails from your own
                        address while preserving authorship information for
                        each patch.  git series format --no-from will
                        instead use the commit author as the "From:"
                        address for each patch mail.  Use this when
                        producing patch files for purposes other than
                        email.

                 -v N | --reroll-count=N
                        Mark the patch series as PATCH vN.  The patch
                        filenames and mail subjects will include the
                        version number.

                 --rfc  Use [RFC PATCH] instead of the standard [PATCH]
                        prefix.

                 --stdout
                        Write the entire patch series to stdout rather than
                        to separate patch files.

                 --subject-prefix=prefix
                        Use [prefix] instead of the standard [PATCH]
                        prefix.

          git series help [subcommand]
                 Show help for git series or a subcommand.  Without
                 arguments, shows a summary of the subcommands supported by
                 git series.

                 subcommand
                        Show help for subcommand.

          git series log [-p|--patch]
                 Show the history of the patch series.

                 -p|--patch
                        Include a patch for each change committed to the
                        series.  This uses the same series diff format as
                        git series diff.

          git series mv [source] dest
                 Move (rename) the series source to dest, including any
                 work in progress, staged or unstaged.  source defaults to
                 the current series if omitted.  Moving the current series
                 will make the destination the current series.

                 You can also invoke this as git series rename.

          git series rebase [-i|--interactive] [onto]
                 Rebase the patch series, either onto a new base,
                 interactively, or both.  The patch series must have a base
                 set with git series base, to identify the series of
                 patches to rebase.

                 onto   Commit to rebase the series onto.  This can use a
                        commit hash, ref name, or special syntaxes such as
                        refname^ or refname~2.

                 -i|--interactive
                        Interactively edit the list of commits.  This uses
                        the same format and syntax as git rebase -i, to
                        allow reordering, dropping, combining, or editing
                        commits.

          git series req [-p|--patch] url tag
                 Generate a mail requesting a pull of the patch series.

                 Before running this command, push the patch series to the
                 repository at url, as a tag or branch named tag.

                 A pull request for a signed or annotated tag will include
                 the message from the tag.  The pull request will also
                 include the cover letter if any, unless the tag message
                 already contains the cover letter.  The subject of the
                 mail will include the first line from the cover letter, or
                 the name of the series if no cover letter.

                 The patch series must have a base set with git series
                 base, to identify the series of patches to request a pull
                 of.

                 url    URL of the repository to pull from.

                 tag    Name of a tag or branch to request a pull from.

                 -p|--patch
                        Include a patch showing the combined change made by
                        all the patches in the series.  This can help a
                        reviewer see the effect of pulling the series.

          git series start name
                 Start a new patch series named name.

          git series status
                 Show the status of the current patch series.

                 This shows any changes staged for the next git series
                 commit, changes in the current working copy but not staged
                 for the next git series commit, and hints about the next
                 commands to run.

          git series unadd change
                 Remove changes from the next git series commit, undoing
                 git series add.

                 The changes remain in the current working version of the
                 series.

                 change...
                        Changes to remove: any combination of "series",
                        "base", and "cover".
