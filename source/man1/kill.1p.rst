   KILL(1P)                POSIX Programmer's Manual               KILL(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          kill — terminate or signal processes


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          kill -s signal_name pid...

          kill -l [exit_status]

          kill [-signal_name] pid...

          kill [-signal_number] pid...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The kill utility shall send a signal to the process or processes
          specified by each pid operand.

          For each pid operand, the kill utility shall perform actions
          equivalent to the kill() function defined in the System
          Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 called with the following
          arguments:

           *  The value of the pid operand shall be used as the pid
              argument.

           *  The sig argument is the value specified by the -s option,
              -signal_number option, or the -signal_name option, or by
              SIGTERM, if none of these options is specified.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The kill utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
          that in the last two SYNOPSIS forms, the -signal_number and
          -signal_name options are usually more than a single character.

          The following options shall be supported:

          -l        (The letter ell.) Write all values of signal_name
                    supported by the implementation, if no operand is
                    given. If an exit_status operand is given and it is a
                    value of the '?'  shell special parameter (see Section
                    2.5.2, Special Parameters and wait) corresponding to a
                    process that was terminated by a signal, the
                    signal_name corresponding to the signal that terminated
                    the process shall be written. If an exit_status operand
                    is given and it is the unsigned decimal integer value
                    of a signal number, the signal_name (the symbolic
                    constant name without the SIG prefix defined in the
                    Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017) corresponding
                    to that signal shall be written. Otherwise, the results
                    are unspecified.

          -s signal_name
                    Specify the signal to send, using one of the symbolic
                    names defined in the <signal.h> header. Values of
                    signal_name shall be recognized in a case-independent
                    fashion, without the SIG prefix. In addition, the
                    symbolic name 0 shall be recognized, representing the
                    signal value zero. The corresponding signal shall be
                    sent instead of SIGTERM.

          -signal_name
                    Equivalent to -s signal_name.

          -signal_number
                    Specify a non-negative decimal integer, signal_number,
                    representing the signal to be used instead of SIGTERM,
                    as the sig argument in the effective call to kill().
                    The correspondence between integer values and the sig
                    value used is shown in the following list.

                    The effects of specifying any signal_number other than
                    those listed below are undefined.

                    0     0

                    1     SIGHUP

                    2     SIGINT

                    3     SIGQUIT

                    6     SIGABRT

                    9     SIGKILL

                    14    SIGALRM

                    15    SIGTERM

                    If the first argument is a negative integer, it shall
                    be interpreted as a -signal_number option, not as a
                    negative pid operand specifying a process group.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operands shall be supported:

          pid       One of the following:

                     1. A decimal integer specifying a process or process
                        group to be signaled.  The process or processes
                        selected by positive, negative, and zero values of
                        the pid operand shall be as described for the
                        kill() function. If process number 0 is specified,
                        all processes in the current process group shall be
                        signaled. For the effects of negative pid numbers,
                        see the kill() function defined in the System
                        Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017. If the first pid
                        operand is negative, it should be preceded by "--"
                        to keep it from being interpreted as an option.

                     2. A job control job ID (see the Base Definitions
                        volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 3.204, Job Control
                        Job ID) that identifies a background process group
                        to be signaled. The job control job ID notation is
                        applicable only for invocations of kill in the
                        current shell execution environment; see Section
                        2.12, Shell Execution Environment.

          exit_status
                    A decimal integer specifying a signal number or the
                    exit status of a process terminated by a signal.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Not used.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          kill:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          When the -l option is not specified, the standard output shall
          not be used.

          When the -l option is specified, the symbolic name of each signal
          shall be written in the following format:

              "%s%c", <signal_name>, <separator>

          where the <signal_name> is in uppercase, without the SIG prefix,
          and the <separator> shall be either a <newline> or a <space>.
          For the last signal written, <separator> shall be a <newline>.

          When both the -l option and exit_status operand are specified,
          the symbolic name of the corresponding signal shall be written in
          the following format:

              "%s\n", <signal_name>


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    At least one matching process was found for each pid
                operand, and the specified signal was successfully
                processed for at least one matching process.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Process numbers can be found by using ps.

          The job control job ID notation is not required to work as
          expected when kill is operating in its own utility execution
          environment. In either of the following examples:

              nohup kill %1 &
              system("kill %1");

          the kill operates in a different environment and does not share
          the shell's understanding of job numbers.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Any of the commands:

              kill -9 100 -165
              kill -s kill 100 -165
              kill -s KILL 100 -165

          sends the SIGKILL signal to the process whose process ID is 100
          and to all processes whose process group ID is 165, assuming the
          sending process has permission to send that signal to the
          specified processes, and that they exist.

          The System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 and this volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017 do not require specific signal numbers for any
          signal_names.  Even the -signal_number option provides symbolic
          (although numeric) names for signals. If a process is terminated
          by a signal, its exit status indicates the signal that killed it,
          but the exact values are not specified. The kill -l option,
          however, can be used to map decimal signal numbers and exit
          status values into the name of a signal. The following example
          reports the status of a terminated job:

              job
              stat=$?
              if [ $stat -eq 0 ]
              then
                  echo job completed successfully.
              elif [ $stat -gt 128 ]
              then
                  echo job terminated by signal SIG$(kill -l $stat).
              else
                  echo job terminated with error code $stat.
              fi

          To send the default signal to a process group (say 123), an
          application should use a command similar to one of the following:

              kill -TERM -123
              kill -- -123


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The -l option originated from the C shell, and is also
          implemented in the KornShell. The C shell output can consist of
          multiple output lines because the signal names do not always fit
          on a single line on some terminal screens. The KornShell output
          also included the implementation-defined signal numbers and was
          considered by the standard developers to be too difficult for
          scripts to parse conveniently. The specified output format is
          intended not only to accommodate the historical C shell output,
          but also to permit an entirely vertical or entirely horizontal
          listing on systems for which this is appropriate.

          An early proposal invented the name SIGNULL as a signal_name for
          signal 0 (used by the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017 to
          test for the existence of a process without sending it a signal).
          Since the signal_name 0 can be used in this case unambiguously,
          SIGNULL has been removed.

          An early proposal also required symbolic signal_names to be
          recognized with or without the SIG prefix. Historical versions of
          kill have not written the SIG prefix for the -l option and have
          not recognized the SIG prefix on signal_names.  Since neither
          applications portability nor ease-of-use would be improved by
          requiring this extension, it is no longer required.

          To avoid an ambiguity of an initial negative number argument
          specifying either a signal number or a process group,
          POSIX.1‐2008 mandates that it is always considered the former by
          implementations that support the XSI option. It also requires
          that conforming applications always use the "--" options
          terminator argument when specifying a process group, unless an
          option is also specified.

          The -s option was added in response to international interest in
          providing some form of kill that meets the Utility Syntax
          Guidelines.

          The job control job ID notation is not required to work as
          expected when kill is operating in its own utility execution
          environment. In either of the following examples:

              nohup kill %1 &
              system("kill %1");

          the kill operates in a different environment and does not
          understand how the shell has managed its job numbers.
