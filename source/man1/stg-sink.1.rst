   STG-SINK(1)                   StGit Manual                   STG-SINK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          stg-sink - Send patches deeper down the stack


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          stg sink [-t <target patch>] [-n] [--] [<patches>]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This is the opposite operation of stg-float(1): move the
          specified patches down the stack. It is for example useful to
          group stable patches near the bottom of the stack, where they are
          less likely to be impacted by the push of another patch, and from
          where they can be more easily committed or pushed.

          If no patch is specified on command-line, the current patch gets
          sunk. By default patches are sunk to the bottom of the stack, but
          the --to option allows one to place them under any applied patch.

          Sinking internally involves popping all patches (or all patches
          including <target patch>), then pushing the patches to sink, and
          then (unless --nopush is also given) pushing back into place the
          formerly-applied patches.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n, --nopush
              Do not push back on the stack the formerly-applied patches.
              Only the patches to sink are pushed.

          -t TARGET, --to TARGET
              Specify a target patch to place the patches below, instead of
              sinking them to the bottom of the stack.

          -k, --keep
              Keep the local changes.
