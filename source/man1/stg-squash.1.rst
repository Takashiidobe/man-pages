   STG-SQUASH(1)                 StGit Manual                 STG-SQUASH(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          stg-squash - Squash two or more patches into one


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          stg squash [options] [--] <patches>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Squash two or more patches, creating one big patch that contains
          all their changes. In more detail:

           1. Pop all the given patches, plus any other patches on top of
              them.

           2. Push the given patches in the order they were given on the
              command line.

           3. Squash the given patches into one big patch.

           4. Allow the user to edit the commit message of the new patch
              interactively.

           5. Push the other patches that were popped in step (1).

          Conflicts can occur whenever we push a patch; that is, in step
          (2) and (5). If there are conflicts, the command will stop so
          that you can resolve them.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n NAME, --name NAME
              Name of squashed patch.

          -m MESSAGE, --message MESSAGE
              Use MESSAGE instead of invoking the editor.

          -f FILE, --file FILE
              Use the contents of FILE instead of invoking the editor. (If
              FILE is "-", write to stdout.)

          --save-template FILE
              Instead of running the command, just write the message
              template to FILE, and exit. (If FILE is "-", write to
              stdout.)

              When driving StGit from another program, it is often useful
              to first call a command with --save-template, then let the
              user edit the message, and then call the same command with
              --file.

          --no-verify
              This option bypasses the commit-msg hook.
