   DUMPKEYS(1)              General Commands Manual             DUMPKEYS(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dumpkeys - dump keyboard translation tables


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dumpkeys [ -h --help -i --short-info -l -s --long-info -n
          --numeric -f --full-table -1 --separate-lines -Sshape
          --shape=shape -t --funcs-only -k --keys-only -d --compose-only
          -ccharset --charset=charset -v --verbose -V --version ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dumpkeys writes, to the standard output, the current contents of
          the keyboard driver's translation tables, in the format specified
          by keymaps(5).

          Using the various options, the format of the output can be
          controlled and also other information from the kernel and the
          programs dumpkeys(1) and loadkeys(1) can be obtained.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -h --help
                 Prints the program's version number and a short usage
                 message to the program's standard error output and exits.

          -i --short-info
                 Prints some characteristics of the kernel's keyboard
                 driver. The items shown are:

                 Keycode range supported by the kernel

                        This tells what values can be used after the
                        keycode keyword in keytable files. See keymaps(5)
                        for more information and the syntax of these files.

                 Number of actions bindable to a key

                        This tells how many different actions a single key
                        can output using various modifier keys. If the
                        value is 16 for example, you can define up to 16
                        different actions to a key combined with modifiers.
                        When the value is 16, the kernel probably knows
                        about four modifier keys, which you can press in
                        different combinations with the key to access all
                        the bound actions.

                 Ranges of action codes supported by the kernel

                        This item contains a list of action code ranges in
                        hexadecimal notation.  These are the values that
                        can be used in the right hand side of a key
                        definition, ie. the vv's in a line

                               keycode xx = vv vv vv vv

                        (see keymaps(5) for more information about the
                        format of key definition lines).  dumpkeys(1) and
                        loadkeys(1) support a symbolic notation, which is
                        preferable to the numeric one, as the action codes
                        may vary from kernel to kernel while the symbolic
                        names usually remain the same. However, the list of
                        action code ranges can be used to determine, if the
                        kernel actually supports all the symbols
                        loadkeys(1) knows, or are there maybe some actions
                        supported by the kernel that have no symbolic name
                        in your loadkeys(1) program. To see this, you
                        compare the range list with the action symbol list,
                        see option --long-info below.

                 Number of function keys supported by kernel

                        This tells the number of action codes that can be
                        used to output strings of characters. These action
                        codes are traditionally bound to the various
                        function and editing keys of the keyboard and are
                        defined to send standard escape sequences. However,
                        you can redefine these to send common command
                        lines, email addresses or whatever you like.
                        Especially if the number of this item is greater
                        than the number of function and editing keys in
                        your keyboard, you may have some "spare" action
                        codes that you can bind to AltGr-letter
                        combinations, for example, to send some useful
                        strings. See loadkeys(1) for more details.

                 Function strings

                        You can see you current function key definitions
                        with the command

                               dumpkeys --funcs-only

          -l -s --long-info
                 This option instructs dumpkeys to print a long information
                 listing. The output is the same as with the --short-info
                 appended with the list of action symbols supported by
                 loadkeys(1) and dumpkeys(1), along with the symbols'
                 numeric values.

          -n --numeric
                 This option causes dumpkeys to by-pass the conversion of
                 action code values to symbolic notation and to print the
                 in hexadecimal format instead.

          -f --full-table
                 This makes dumpkeys skip all the short-hand heuristics
                 (see keymaps(5)) and output the key bindings in the
                 canonical form. First a keymaps line describing the
                 currently defined modifier combinations is printed. Then
                 for each key a row with a column for each modifier
                 combination is printed. For example, if the current keymap
                 in use uses seven modifiers, every row will have seven
                 action code columns. This format can be useful for example
                 to programs that post-process the output of dumpkeys.

          -Sshape  --shape=shape

          -t --funcs-only
                 When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the
                 function key string definitions. Normally dumpkeys prints
                 both the key bindings and the string definitions.

          -k --keys-only
                 When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the key
                 bindings. Normally dumpkeys prints both the key bindings
                 and the string definitions.

          -d --compose-only
                 When this option is given, dumpkeys prints only the
                 compose key combinations.  This option is available only
                 if your kernel has compose key support.

          -ccharset  --charset=charset
                 This instructs dumpkeys to interpret character code values
                 according to the specified character set. This affects
                 only the translation of character code values to symbolic
                 names. Valid values for charset currently are iso-8859-X,
                 Where X is a digit in 1-9.  If no charset is specified,
                 iso-8859-1 is used as a default.  This option produces an
                 output line `charset "iso-8859-X"', telling loadkeys how
                 to interpret the keymap. (For example, "division" is 0xf7
                 in iso-8859-1 but 0xba in iso-8859-8.)

          -v --verbose

          -V --version
                 Prints version number and exits.
