   SAR2PCP(1)               General Commands Manual              SAR2PCP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sar2pcp - import sar data and create a PCP archive


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          sar2pcp infile outfile


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          sar2pcp is intended to read a binary System Activity Reporting
          (sar) data file as created by sadc(1) (infile) and translate this
          into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive with the basename
          outfile.

          However, if infile has the suffix ``.xml'', then it will be
          considered already in XML format and sar2pcp will operate
          directly on it.

          The resultant PCP achive may be used with all the PCP client
          tools to graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
          reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
          pmie(1), etc.

          A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
          outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
          outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
          and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
          replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
          already, then sar2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit with
          an error message of the form

          __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written

          sar2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
          wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
          be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
          of performance data and create PCP archives.  A Python wrapper
          module is also available.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          As of sysstat version 12.0.5, sadc(1) has added functionality to
          directly write PCP archive files.  To produce archive files from
          sar run:

          $ sadf -l -O pcparchive=ARCHIVE_NAME sar.dat -- -A


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          When not using the XML input option, sar2pcp requires infile to
          have been created by a version of sadc(1) from
          http://sebastien.godard.pagesperso-orange.fr/ which includes the
          sadf(1) utility to translate infile into an XML stream (any since
          version 6); sar2pcp will automatically run sadf(1) and translate
          the resultant XML into a PCP archive.

          When using binary sadc files it is important to ensure the
          installed sadf is compatible with the version of sadc that
          originally generated the binary files.  Simply assuming a newer
          installed version will work is unfortunately far too optimistic,
          and nor should one assume that binary data from different
          platforms (e.g. different endianness) will work - these issues
          are due to limitations in sadc and sadf, and not in sar2pcp
          itself.

          Fortunately, the sadf message indicating that an incompatibility
          has been detected is consistent across versions, and is always
          prefixed

          Invalid system activity file

          Using an XML infile has the advantage that the installed version
          of sadf is completely bypassed.  sar2pcp undertakes to transform
          any valid XML produced by any of the different variations of sadf
          into a valid PCP archive.  Any version of PCP will be able to
          interpret the archive files produced by any version of sar2pcp,
          and you are also free to move the binary PCP archive between
          different platforms, different hardware, even different operating
          systems - it Just Works (TM).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).

          For environment variables affecting PCP tools, see
          pmGetOptions(3).

          pmlogsummary(1), sadc(1), sadf(1), sar(1), Date::Parse(3pm),
          Date::Format(3pm), PCP::LogImport(3pm), XML::TokeParser(3pm) and
          LOGIMPORT(3).
