   CHOWN(1P)               POSIX Programmer's Manual              CHOWN(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          chown — change the file ownership


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          chown [-h] owner[:group] file...

          chown -R [-H|-L|-P] owner[:group] file...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The chown utility shall set the user ID of the file named by each
          file operand to the user ID specified by the owner operand.

          For each file operand, or, if the -R option is used, each file
          encountered while walking the directory trees specified by the
          file operands, the chown utility shall perform actions equivalent
          to the chown() function defined in the System Interfaces volume
          of POSIX.1‐2017, called with the following arguments:

           1. The file operand shall be used as the path argument.

           2. The user ID indicated by the owner portion of the first
              operand shall be used as the owner argument.

           3. If the group portion of the first operand is given, the group
              ID indicated by it shall be used as the group argument;
              otherwise, the group ownership shall not be changed.

          Unless chown is invoked by a process with appropriate privileges,
          the set-user-ID and set-group-ID bits of a regular file shall be
          cleared upon successful completion; the set-user-ID and set-
          group-ID bits of other file types may be cleared.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The chown utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

          The following options shall be supported by the implementation:

          -h        For each file operand that names a file of type
                    symbolic link, chown shall attempt to set the user ID
                    of the symbolic link. If a group ID was specified, for
                    each file operand that names a file of type symbolic
                    link, chown shall attempt to set the group ID of the
                    symbolic link.

          -H        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
                    referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                    the command line, chown shall change the user ID (and
                    group ID, if specified) of the directory referenced by
                    the symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy
                    below it.

          -L        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link
                    referencing a file of type directory is specified on
                    the command line or encountered during the traversal of
                    a file hierarchy, chown shall change the user ID (and
                    group ID, if specified) of the directory referenced by
                    the symbolic link and all files in the file hierarchy
                    below it.

          -P        If the -R option is specified and a symbolic link is
                    specified on the command line or encountered during the
                    traversal of a file hierarchy, chown shall change the
                    owner ID (and group ID, if specified) of the symbolic
                    link. The chown utility shall not follow the symbolic
                    link to any other part of the file hierarchy.

          -R        Recursively change file user and group IDs. For each
                    file operand that names a directory, chown shall change
                    the user ID (and group ID, if specified) of the
                    directory and all files in the file hierarchy below it.
                    Unless a -H, -L, or -P option is specified, it is
                    unspecified which of these options will be used as the
                    default.

          Specifying more than one of the mutually-exclusive options -H,
          -L, and -P shall not be considered an error. The last option
          specified shall determine the behavior of the utility.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operands shall be supported:

          owner[:group]
                    A user ID and optional group ID to be assigned to file.
                    The owner portion of this operand shall be a user name
                    from the user database or a numeric user ID. Either
                    specifies a user ID which shall be given to each file
                    named by one of the file operands. If a numeric owner
                    operand exists in the user database as a user name, the
                    user ID number associated with that user name shall be
                    used as the user ID. Similarly, if the group portion of
                    this operand is present, it shall be a group name from
                    the group database or a numeric group ID. Either
                    specifies a group ID which shall be given to each file.
                    If a numeric group operand exists in the group database
                    as a group name, the group ID number associated with
                    that group name shall be used as the group ID.

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          chown:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    The utility executed successfully and all requested changes
                were made.

          >0    An error occurred.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Only the owner of a file or the user with appropriate privileges
          may change the owner or group of a file.

          Some implementations restrict the use of chown to a user with
          appropriate privileges.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          None.


-----------------------------------------------------------

          The System V and BSD versions use different exit status codes.
          Some implementations used the exit status as a count of the
          number of errors that occurred; this practice is unworkable since
          it can overflow the range of valid exit status values. These are
          masked by specifying only 0 and >0 as exit values.

          The functionality of chown is described substantially through
          references to functions in the System Interfaces volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017. In this way, there is no duplication of effort
          required for describing the interactions of permissions, multiple
          groups, and so on.

          The 4.3 BSD method of specifying both owner and group was
          included in this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because:

           *  There are cases where the desired end condition could not be
              achieved using the chgrp and chown (that only changed the
              user ID) utilities. (If the current owner is not a member of
              the desired group and the desired owner is not a member of
              the current group, the chown() function could fail unless
              both owner and group are changed at the same time.)

           *  Even if they could be changed independently, in cases where
              both are being changed, there is a 100% performance penalty
              caused by being forced to invoke both utilities.

          The BSD syntax user[.group] was changed to user[:group] in this
          volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because the <period> is a valid character
          in login names (as specified by the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, login names consist of characters in the portable
          filename character set). The <colon> character was chosen as the
          replacement for the <period> character because it would never be
          allowed as a character in a user name or group name on historical
          implementations.

          The -R option is considered by some observers as an undesirable
          departure from the historical UNIX system tools approach; since a
          tool, find, already exists to recurse over directories, there
          seemed to be no good reason to require other tools to have to
          duplicate that functionality.  However, the -R option was deemed
          an important user convenience, is far more efficient than forking
          a separate process for each element of the directory hierarchy,
          and is in widespread historical use.
