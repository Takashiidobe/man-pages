   GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1)            Git Manual            GIT-RECEIVE-PACK(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-receive-pack - Receive what is pushed into the repository


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git-receive-pack <directory>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Invoked by git send-pack and updates the repository with the
          information fed from the remote end.

          This command is usually not invoked directly by the end user. The
          UI for the protocol is on the git send-pack side, and the program
          pair is meant to be used to push updates to remote repository.
          For pull operations, see git-fetch-pack(1).

          The command allows for creation and fast-forwarding of sha1 refs
          (heads/tags) on the remote end (strictly speaking, it is the
          local end git-receive-pack runs, but to the user who is sitting
          at the send-pack end, it is updating the remote. Confused?)

          There are other real-world examples of using update and
          post-update hooks found in the Documentation/howto directory.

          git-receive-pack honours the receive.denyNonFastForwards config
          option, which tells it if updates to a ref should be denied if
          they are not fast-forwards.

          A number of other receive.* config options are available to tweak
          its behavior, see git-config(1).


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          <directory>
              The repository to sync into.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Before any ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/pre-receive file
          exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with no
          parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one line per
          ref to be updated:

              sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF

          The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
          head this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 values before each
          refname are the object names for the refname before and after the
          update. Refs to be created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40},
          while refs to be deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40},
          otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the
          repository.

          When accepting a signed push (see git-push(1)), the signed push
          certificate is stored in a blob and an environment variable
          GIT_PUSH_CERT can be consulted for its object name. See the
          description of post-receive hook for an example. In addition, the
          certificate is verified using GPG and the result is exported with
          the following environment variables:

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER
              The name and the e-mail address of the owner of the key that
              signed the push certificate.

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_KEY
              The GPG key ID of the key that signed the push certificate.

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS
              The status of GPG verification of the push certificate, using
              the same mnemonic as used in %G?  format of git log family of
              commands (see git-log(1)).

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE
              The nonce string the process asked the signer to include in
              the push certificate. If this does not match the value
              recorded on the "nonce" header in the push certificate, it
              may indicate that the certificate is a valid one that is
              being replayed from a separate "git push" session.

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS

              UNSOLICITED
                  "git push --signed" sent a nonce when we did not ask it
                  to send one.

              MISSING
                  "git push --signed" did not send any nonce header.

              BAD
                  "git push --signed" sent a bogus nonce.

              OK
                  "git push --signed" sent the nonce we asked it to send.

              SLOP
                  "git push --signed" sent a nonce different from what we
                  asked it to send now, but in a previous session. See
                  GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP environment variable.

          GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_SLOP
              "git push --signed" sent a nonce different from what we asked
              it to send now, but in a different session whose starting
              time is different by this many seconds from the current
              session. Only meaningful when GIT_PUSH_CERT_NONCE_STATUS says
              SLOP. Also read about receive.certNonceSlop variable in
              git-config(1).

          This hook is called before any refname is updated and before any
          fast-forward checks are performed.

          If the pre-receive hook exits with a non-zero exit status no
          updates will be performed, and the update, post-receive and
          post-update hooks will not be invoked either. This can be useful
          to quickly bail out if the update is not to be supported.

          See the notes on the quarantine environment below.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Before each ref is updated, if $GIT_DIR/hooks/update file exists
          and is executable, it is invoked once per ref, with three
          parameters:

              $GIT_DIR/hooks/update refname sha1-old sha1-new

          The refname parameter is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the
          master head this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 arguments
          are the object names for the refname before and after the update.
          Note that the hook is called before the refname is updated, so
          either sha1-old is 0{40} (meaning there is no such ref yet), or
          it should match what is recorded in refname.

          The hook should exit with non-zero status if it wants to disallow
          updating the named ref. Otherwise it should exit with zero.

          Successful execution (a zero exit status) of this hook does not
          ensure the ref will actually be updated, it is only a
          prerequisite. As such it is not a good idea to send notices (e.g.
          email) from this hook. Consider using the post-receive hook
          instead.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          After all refs were updated (or attempted to be updated), if any
          ref update was successful, and if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-receive
          file exists and is executable, it will be invoked once with no
          parameters. The standard input of the hook will be one line for
          each successfully updated ref:

              sha1-old SP sha1-new SP refname LF

          The refname value is relative to $GIT_DIR; e.g. for the master
          head this is "refs/heads/master". The two sha1 values before each
          refname are the object names for the refname before and after the
          update. Refs that were created will have sha1-old equal to 0{40},
          while refs that were deleted will have sha1-new equal to 0{40},
          otherwise sha1-old and sha1-new should be valid objects in the
          repository.

          The GIT_PUSH_CERT* environment variables can be inspected, just
          as in pre-receive hook, after accepting a signed push.

          Using this hook, it is easy to generate mails describing the
          updates to the repository. This example script sends one mail
          message per ref listing the commits pushed to the repository, and
          logs the push certificates of signed pushes with good signatures
          to a logger service:

              #!/bin/sh
              # mail out commit update information.
              while read oval nval ref
              do
                      if expr "$oval" : '0*$' >/dev/null
                      then
                              echo "Created a new ref, with the following commits:"
                              git rev-list --pretty "$nval"
                      else
                              echo "New commits:"
                              git rev-list --pretty "$nval" "^$oval"
                      fi |
                      mail -s "Changes to ref $ref" commit-list@mydomain
              done
              # log signed push certificate, if any
              if test -n "${GIT_PUSH_CERT-}" && test ${GIT_PUSH_CERT_STATUS} = G
              then
                      (
                              echo expected nonce is ${GIT_PUSH_NONCE}
                              git cat-file blob ${GIT_PUSH_CERT}
                      ) | mail -s "push certificate from $GIT_PUSH_CERT_SIGNER" push-log@mydomain
              fi
              exit 0

          The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored, however a
          non-zero exit code will generate an error message.

          Note that it is possible for refname to not have sha1-new when
          this hook runs. This can easily occur if another user modifies
          the ref after it was updated by git-receive-pack, but before the
          hook was able to evaluate it. It is recommended that hooks rely
          on sha1-new rather than the current value of refname.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          After all other processing, if at least one ref was updated, and
          if $GIT_DIR/hooks/post-update file exists and is executable, then
          post-update will be called with the list of refs that have been
          updated. This can be used to implement any repository wide
          cleanup tasks.

          The exit code from this hook invocation is ignored; the only
          thing left for git-receive-pack to do at that point is to exit
          itself anyway.

          This hook can be used, for example, to run git update-server-info
          if the repository is packed and is served via a dumb transport.

              #!/bin/sh
              exec git update-server-info


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          When receive-pack takes in objects, they are placed into a
          temporary "quarantine" directory within the $GIT_DIR/objects
          directory and migrated into the main object store only after the
          pre-receive hook has completed. If the push fails before then,
          the temporary directory is removed entirely.

          This has a few user-visible effects and caveats:

           1. Pushes which fail due to problems with the incoming pack,
              missing objects, or due to the pre-receive hook will not
              leave any on-disk data. This is usually helpful to prevent
              repeated failed pushes from filling up your disk, but can
              make debugging more challenging.

           2. Any objects created by the pre-receive hook will be created
              in the quarantine directory (and migrated only if it
              succeeds).

           3. The pre-receive hook MUST NOT update any refs to point to
              quarantined objects. Other programs accessing the repository
              will not be able to see the objects (and if the pre-receive
              hook fails, those refs would become corrupted). For safety,
              any ref updates from within pre-receive are automatically
              rejected.
