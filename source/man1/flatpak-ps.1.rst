::

          Lists useful information about running Flatpak instances.

          To see full details of a running instance, you can open the file
          /run/user/$UID/.flatpak/$INSTANCE/info, where $INSTANCE is the
          instance ID reported by flatpak ps.

::

          The following options are understood:

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

              Print debug information during command processing.

              Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

          --columns=FIELD,...
              Specify what information to show about each instance. You can
              list multiple fields, or use this option multiple times.

              Append :s[tart], :m[iddle], :e[nd] or :f[ull] to column names
              to change ellipsization.
