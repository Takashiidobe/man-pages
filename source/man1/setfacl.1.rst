   SETFACL(1)                Access Control Lists                SETFACL(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          setfacl - set file access control lists


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          setfacl [-bkndRLPvh] [{-m|-x} acl_spec] [{-M|-X} acl_file] file
          ...

          setfacl --restore=file


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This utility sets Access Control Lists (ACLs) of files and
          directories.  On the command line, a sequence of commands is
          followed by a sequence of files (which in turn can be followed by
          another sequence of commands, ...).

          The -m and -x options expect an ACL on the command line. Multiple
          ACL entries are separated by comma characters (`,'). The -M and
          -X options read an ACL from a file or from standard input. The
          ACL entry format is described in Section ACL ENTRIES.

          The --set and --set-file options set the ACL of a file or a
          directory. The previous ACL is replaced.  ACL entries for this
          operation must include permissions.

          The -m (--modify) and -M (--modify-file) options modify the ACL
          of a file or directory.  ACL entries for this operation must
          include permissions.

          The -x (--remove) and -X (--remove-file) options remove ACL
          entries. It is not an error to remove an entry which does not
          exist.  Only ACL entries without the perms field are accepted as
          parameters, unless POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined.

          When reading from files using the -M and -X options, setfacl
          accepts the output getfacl produces.  There is at most one ACL
          entry per line. After a Pound sign (`#'), everything up to the
          end of the line is treated as a comment.

          If setfacl is used on a file system which does not support ACLs,
          setfacl operates on the file mode permission bits. If the ACL
          does not fit completely in the permission bits, setfacl modifies
          the file mode permission bits to reflect the ACL as closely as
          possible, writes an error message to standard error, and returns
          with an exit status greater than 0.

      PERMISSIONS
          The file owner and processes capable of CAP_FOWNER are granted
          the right to modify ACLs of a file. This is analogous to the
          permissions required for accessing the file mode. (On current
          Linux systems, root is the only user with the CAP_FOWNER
          capability.)


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -b, --remove-all
              Remove all extended ACL entries. The base ACL entries of the
              owner, group and others are retained.

          -k, --remove-default
              Remove the Default ACL. If no Default ACL exists, no warnings
              are issued.

          -n, --no-mask
              Do not recalculate the effective rights mask. The default
              behavior of setfacl is to recalculate the ACL mask entry,
              unless a mask entry was explicitly given.  The mask entry is
              set to the union of all permissions of the owning group, and
              all named user and group entries. (These are exactly the
              entries affected by the mask entry).

          --mask
              Do recalculate the effective rights mask, even if an ACL mask
              entry was explicitly given. (See the -n option.)

          -d, --default
              All operations apply to the Default ACL. Regular ACL entries
              in the input set are promoted to Default ACL entries. Default
              ACL entries in the input set are discarded. (A warning is
              issued if that happens).

          --restore=file
              Restore a permission backup created by `getfacl -R' or
              similar. All permissions of a complete directory subtree are
              restored using this mechanism. If the input contains owner
              comments or group comments, setfacl attempts to restore the
              owner and owning group. If the input contains flags comments
              (which define the setuid, setgid, and sticky bits), setfacl
              sets those three bits accordingly; otherwise, it clears them.
              This option cannot be mixed with other options except
              `--test'.

          --test
              Test mode. Instead of changing the ACLs of any files, the
              resulting ACLs are listed.

          -R, --recursive
              Apply operations to all files and directories recursively.
              This option cannot be mixed with `--restore'.

          -L, --logical
              Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The
              default behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and
              skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.  Only
              effective in combination with -R.  This option cannot be
              mixed with `--restore'.

          -P, --physical
              Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
              This also skips symbolic link arguments.  Only effective in
              combination with -R.  This option cannot be mixed with
              `--restore'.

          -v, --version
              Print the version of setfacl and exit.

          -h, --help
              Print help explaining the command line options.

          --  End of command line options. All remaining parameters are
              interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash.

          -   If the file name parameter is a single dash, setfacl reads a
              list of files from standard input.

      ACL ENTRIES
          The setfacl utility recognizes the following ACL entry formats
          (blanks inserted for clarity):

          [d[efault]:] [u[ser]:]uid [:perms]
                 Permissions of a named user. Permissions of the file owner
                 if uid is empty.

          [d[efault]:] g[roup]:gid [:perms]
                 Permissions of a named group. Permissions of the owning
                 group if gid is empty.

          [d[efault]:] m[ask][:] [:perms]
                 Effective rights mask

          [d[efault]:] o[ther][:] [:perms]
                 Permissions of others.

          Whitespace between delimiter characters and non-delimiter
          characters is ignored.

          Proper ACL entries including permissions are used in modify and
          set operations. (options -m, -M, --set and --set-file).  Entries
          without the perms field are used for deletion of entries (options
          -x and -X).

          For uid and gid you can specify either a name or a number.
          Character literals may be specified with a backslash followed by
          the 3-digit octal digits corresponding to the ASCII code for the
          character (e.g., \101 for 'A').  If the name contains a literal
          backslash followed by 3 digits, the backslash must be escaped
          (i.e., \\).

          The perms field is a combination of characters that indicate the
          read (r), write (w), execute (x) permissions.  Dash characters in
          the perms field (-) are ignored.  The character X stands for the
          execute permission if the file is a directory or already has
          execute permission for some user.  Alternatively, the perms field
          can define the permissions numerically, as a bit-wise combination
          of read (4), write (2), and execute (1).  Zero perms fields or
          perms fields that only consist of dashes indicate no permissions.

      AUTOMATICALLY CREATED ENTRIES
          Initially, files and directories contain only the three base ACL
          entries for the owner, the group, and others. There are some
          rules that need to be satisfied in order for an ACL to be valid:

          *   The three base entries cannot be removed. There must be
              exactly one entry of each of these base entry types.

          *   Whenever an ACL contains named user entries or named group
              objects, it must also contain an effective rights mask.

          *   Whenever an ACL contains any Default ACL entries, the three
              Default ACL base entries (default owner, default group, and
              default others) must also exist.

          *   Whenever a Default ACL contains named user entries or named
              group objects, it must also contain a default effective
              rights mask.

          To help the user ensure these rules, setfacl creates entries from
          existing entries under the following conditions:

          *   If an ACL contains named user or named group entries, and no
              mask entry exists, a mask entry containing the same
              permissions as the group entry is created. Unless the -n
              option is given, the permissions of the mask entry are
              further adjusted to include the union of all permissions
              affected by the mask entry. (See the -n option description).

          *   If a Default ACL entry is created, and the Default ACL
              contains no owner, owning group, or others entry, a copy of
              the ACL owner, owning group, or others entry is added to the
              Default ACL.

          *   If a Default ACL contains named user entries or named group
              entries, and no mask entry exists, a mask entry containing
              the same permissions as the default Default ACL's group entry
              is added. Unless the -n option is given, the permissions of
              the mask entry are further adjusted to include the union of
              all permissions affected by the mask entry. (See the -n
              option description).

::

          If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the
          default behavior of setfacl changes as follows: All non-standard
          options are disabled.  The ``default:'' prefix is disabled.  The
          -x and -X options also accept permission fields (and ignore
          them).
