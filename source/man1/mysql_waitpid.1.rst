   MYSQL_WAITPID(1)         MariaDB Database System        MYSQL_WAITPID(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_waitpid - kill process and wait for its termination


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_waitpid signals a process to terminate and waits for the
          process to exit. It uses the kill() system call and Unix signals,
          so it runs on Unix and Unix-like systems.

          Invoke mysql_waitpid like this:

              shell> mysql_waitpid [options] pid wait_time

          mysql_waitpid sends signal 0 to the process identified by pid and
          waits up to wait_time seconds for the process to terminate.  pid
          and wait_time must be positive integers.

          If process termination occurs within the wait time or the process
          does not exist, mysql_waitpid returns 0. Otherwise, it returns 1.

          If the kill() system call cannot handle signal 0, mysql_waitpid()
          uses signal 1 instead.

          mysql_waitpid supports the following options:

          •   --help, -?, -I

              Display a help message and exit.

          •   --verbose, -v

              Verbose mode. Display a warning if signal 0 could not be used
              and signal 1 is used instead.

          •   --version, -V

              Display version information and exit.
