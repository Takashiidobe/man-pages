   GIT-DESCRIBE(1)                Git Manual                GIT-DESCRIBE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-describe - Give an object a human readable name based on an
          available ref


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git describe [--all] [--tags] [--contains] [--abbrev=<n>] [<commit-ish>...]
          git describe [--all] [--tags] [--contains] [--abbrev=<n>] --dirty[=<mark>]
          git describe <blob>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The command finds the most recent tag that is reachable from a
          commit. If the tag points to the commit, then only the tag is
          shown. Otherwise, it suffixes the tag name with the number of
          additional commits on top of the tagged object and the
          abbreviated object name of the most recent commit. The result is
          a "human-readable" object name which can also be used to identify
          the commit to other git commands.

          By default (without --all or --tags) git describe only shows
          annotated tags. For more information about creating annotated
          tags see the -a and -s options to git-tag(1).

          If the given object refers to a blob, it will be described as
          <commit-ish>:<path>, such that the blob can be found at <path> in
          the <commit-ish>, which itself describes the first commit in
          which this blob occurs in a reverse revision walk from HEAD.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          <commit-ish>...
              Commit-ish object names to describe. Defaults to HEAD if
              omitted.

          --dirty[=<mark>], --broken[=<mark>]
              Describe the state of the working tree. When the working tree
              matches HEAD, the output is the same as "git describe HEAD".
              If the working tree has local modification "-dirty" is
              appended to it. If a repository is corrupt and Git cannot
              determine if there is local modification, Git will error out,
              unless ‘--broken’ is given, which appends the suffix
              "-broken" instead.

          --all
              Instead of using only the annotated tags, use any ref found
              in refs/ namespace. This option enables matching any known
              branch, remote-tracking branch, or lightweight tag.

          --tags
              Instead of using only the annotated tags, use any tag found
              in refs/tags namespace. This option enables matching a
              lightweight (non-annotated) tag.

          --contains
              Instead of finding the tag that predates the commit, find the
              tag that comes after the commit, and thus contains it.
              Automatically implies --tags.

          --abbrev=<n>
              Instead of using the default number of hexadecimal digits
              (which will vary according to the number of objects in the
              repository with a default of 7) of the abbreviated object
              name, use <n> digits, or as many digits as needed to form a
              unique object name. An <n> of 0 will suppress long format,
              only showing the closest tag.

          --candidates=<n>
              Instead of considering only the 10 most recent tags as
              candidates to describe the input commit-ish consider up to
              <n> candidates. Increasing <n> above 10 will take slightly
              longer but may produce a more accurate result. An <n> of 0
              will cause only exact matches to be output.

          --exact-match
              Only output exact matches (a tag directly references the
              supplied commit). This is a synonym for --candidates=0.

          --debug
              Verbosely display information about the searching strategy
              being employed to standard error. The tag name will still be
              printed to standard out.

          --long
              Always output the long format (the tag, the number of commits
              and the abbreviated commit name) even when it matches a tag.
              This is useful when you want to see parts of the commit
              object name in "describe" output, even when the commit in
              question happens to be a tagged version. Instead of just
              emitting the tag name, it will describe such a commit as
              v1.2-0-gdeadbee (0th commit since tag v1.2 that points at
              object deadbee....).

          --match <pattern>
              Only consider tags matching the given glob(7) pattern,
              excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix. If used with --all, it
              also considers local branches and remote-tracking references
              matching the pattern, excluding respectively "refs/heads/"
              and "refs/remotes/" prefix; references of other types are
              never considered. If given multiple times, a list of patterns
              will be accumulated, and tags matching any of the patterns
              will be considered. Use --no-match to clear and reset the
              list of patterns.

          --exclude <pattern>
              Do not consider tags matching the given glob(7) pattern,
              excluding the "refs/tags/" prefix. If used with --all, it
              also does not consider local branches and remote-tracking
              references matching the pattern, excluding respectively
              "refs/heads/" and "refs/remotes/" prefix; references of other
              types are never considered. If given multiple times, a list
              of patterns will be accumulated and tags matching any of the
              patterns will be excluded. When combined with --match a tag
              will be considered when it matches at least one --match
              pattern and does not match any of the --exclude patterns. Use
              --no-exclude to clear and reset the list of patterns.

          --always
              Show uniquely abbreviated commit object as fallback.

          --first-parent
              Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge
              commit. This is useful when you wish to not match tags on
              branches merged in the history of the target commit.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          With something like git.git current tree, I get:

              [torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe parent
              v1.0.4-14-g2414721

          i.e. the current head of my "parent" branch is based on v1.0.4,
          but since it has a few commits on top of that, describe has added
          the number of additional commits ("14") and an abbreviated object
          name for the commit itself ("2414721") at the end.

          The number of additional commits is the number of commits which
          would be displayed by "git log v1.0.4..parent". The hash suffix
          is "-g" + an unambigous abbreviation for the tip commit of parent
          (which was 2414721b194453f058079d897d13c4e377f92dc6). The length
          of the abbreviation scales as the repository grows, using the
          approximate number of objects in the repository and a bit of math
          around the birthday paradox, and defaults to a minimum of 7. The
          "g" prefix stands for "git" and is used to allow describing the
          version of a software depending on the SCM the software is
          managed with. This is useful in an environment where people may
          use different SCMs.

          Doing a git describe on a tag-name will just show the tag name:

              [torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe v1.0.4
              v1.0.4

          With --all, the command can use branch heads as references, so
          the output shows the reference path as well:

              [torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --all --abbrev=4 v1.0.5^2
              tags/v1.0.0-21-g975b

              [torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --all --abbrev=4 HEAD^
              heads/lt/describe-7-g975b

          With --abbrev set to 0, the command can be used to find the
          closest tagname without any suffix:

              [torvalds@g5 git]$ git describe --abbrev=0 v1.0.5^2
              tags/v1.0.0

          Note that the suffix you get if you type these commands today may
          be longer than what Linus saw above when he ran these commands,
          as your Git repository may have new commits whose object names
          begin with 975b that did not exist back then, and "-g975b" suffix
          alone may not be sufficient to disambiguate these commits.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          For each commit-ish supplied, git describe will first look for a
          tag which tags exactly that commit. Annotated tags will always be
          preferred over lightweight tags, and tags with newer dates will
          always be preferred over tags with older dates. If an exact match
          is found, its name will be output and searching will stop.

          If an exact match was not found, git describe will walk back
          through the commit history to locate an ancestor commit which has
          been tagged. The ancestor’s tag will be output along with an
          abbreviation of the input commit-ish’s SHA-1. If --first-parent
          was specified then the walk will only consider the first parent
          of each commit.

          If multiple tags were found during the walk then the tag which
          has the fewest commits different from the input commit-ish will
          be selected and output. Here fewest commits different is defined
          as the number of commits which would be shown by git log
          tag..input will be the smallest number of commits possible.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Tree objects as well as tag objects not pointing at commits,
          cannot be described. When describing blobs, the lightweight tags
          pointing at blobs are ignored, but the blob is still described as
          <committ-ish>:<path> despite the lightweight tag being favorable.
