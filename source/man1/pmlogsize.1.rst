   PMLOGSIZE(1)             General Commands Manual            PMLOGSIZE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsize - report sizes for parts of PCP archive(s)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsize [-drv?]  [-x threshold] archive [...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmlogsize prints information about the size of the index,
          metadata and data sections of a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
          archive.  The output is intended to guide improvements in archive
          encoding format for PCP developers and to help trim pmlogger(1)
          configuration files to remove metrics that are bloating the PCP
          archives with low-value data in production environments.

          The archive arguments can be any mixture of the names of the
          physical files of a PCP archive or the basename that is common to
          all the component physical files in a single archive.  In the
          latter case archive is replaced by a list of all of the matching
          component file names.

          Note the semantics is a little different to other PCP tools in
          that foo.meta means just the file foo.meta, not foo.index,
          foo.meta, foo.0, etc.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -d, --detail
               Enable detailed reporting.  This means space per instance
               domain in a metadata file and space per metric (for values)
               in a data file.

          -r, --replication
               Display additional information about possible replicated
               values in the data file and replicated instances in the
               metadata file.  This option implies -d.

          -x threshold, --threshold=threshold
               With -d (or -r), cut off the report after at least threshold
               percent of the associated space (metric values or instance
               domains) has been reported.  The default behaviour is
               equivalent to threshold being set to 100.

          -v, --verbose
               Enable verbose mode.  This option can be provided more than
               once for additional verbosity.

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
