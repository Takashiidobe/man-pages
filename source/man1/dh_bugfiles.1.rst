   DH_BUGFILES(1)                  Debhelper                 DH_BUGFILES(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_bugfiles - install bug reporting customization files into
          package build directories


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_bugfiles [-A] [debhelper options]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_bugfiles is a debhelper program that is responsible for
          installing bug reporting customization files (bug scripts and/or
          bug control files and/or presubj files) into package build
          directories.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          debian/package.bug-script
              This is the script to be run by the bug reporting program for
              generating a bug report template. This file is installed as
              usr/share/bug/package in the package build directory if no
              other types of bug reporting customization files are going to
              be installed for the package in question. Otherwise, this
              file is installed as usr/share/bug/package/script. Finally,
              the installed script is given execute permissions.

          debian/package.bug-control
              It is the bug control file containing some directions for the
              bug reporting tool. This file is installed as
              usr/share/bug/package/control in the package build directory.

          debian/package.bug-presubj
              The contents of this file are displayed to the user by the
              bug reporting tool before allowing the user to write a bug
              report on the package to the Debian Bug Tracking System. This
              file is installed as usr/share/bug/package/presubj in the
              package build directory.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -A, --all
              Install debian/bug-* files to ALL packages acted on when
              respective debian/package.bug-* files do not exist. Normally,
              debian/bug-* will be installed to the first package only.
