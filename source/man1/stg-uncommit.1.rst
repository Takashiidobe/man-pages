   STG-UNCOMMIT(1)               StGit Manual               STG-UNCOMMIT(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          stg-uncommit - Turn regular git commits into StGit patches


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          stg uncommit [--] <patch-name-1> [<patch-name-2> ...]
          stg uncommit -n NUM [--] [<prefix>]
          stg uncommit -t <committish> [-x]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Take one or more git commits at the base of the current stack and
          turn them into StGIT patches. The new patches are created as
          applied patches at the bottom of the stack. This is the opposite
          of stg commit.

          By default, the number of patches to uncommit is determined by
          the number of patch names provided on the command line. First
          name is used for the first patch to uncommit, i.e. for the newest
          patch.

          The -n/--number option specifies the number of patches to
          uncommit. In this case, at most one patch name may be specified.
          It is used as prefix to which the patch number is appended. If no
          patch names are provided on the command line, StGIT automatically
          generates them based on the first line of the patch description.

          The -t/--to option specifies that all commits up to and including
          the given commit should be uncommitted.

          Only commits with exactly one parent can be uncommitted; in other
          words, you can’t uncommit a merge.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n NUMBER, --number NUMBER
              Uncommit the specified number of commits.

          -t TO, --to TO
              Uncommit to the specified commit.

          -x, --exclusive
              Exclude the commit specified by the --to option.
