   FLATPAK ENTER(1)              flatpak enter             FLATPAK ENTER(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak-enter - Enter an application or runtime's sandbox


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak enter [OPTION...] INSTANCE COMMAND [ARG...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Enter a running sandbox.

          INSTANCE must be either the pid of a process running in a flatpak
          sandbox, or the ID of a running application, or the instance ID
          of a running sandbox. You can use flatpak ps to find the instance
          IDs of running flatpaks.

          COMMAND is the command to run in the sandbox. Extra arguments are
          passed on to the command.

          This creates a new process within the running sandbox, with the
          same environment. This is useful when you want to debug a problem
          with a running application.

          This command works as a regular user if the system support
          unprivileged user namespace. If that is not available you need to
          run run it like: sudo -E flatpak enter.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following options are understood:

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

          -v, --verbose
              Print debug information during command processing.

          --ostree-verbose
              Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
