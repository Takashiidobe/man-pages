NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_setpermission - interactively set permissions in grant
          tables


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_setpermission [options]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          mysql_setpermission is a Perl script that was originally written
          and contributed by Luuk de Boer. It interactively sets
          permissions in the MariaDB grant tables.  mysql_setpermission is
          written in Perl and requires that the DBI and DBD::MariaDB Perl
          modules be installed.

          Invoke mysql_setpermission like this:

              shell> mysql_setpermission [options]

          options should be either --help to display the help message, or
          options that indicate how to connect to the MariaDB server. The
          account used when you connect determines which permissions you
          have when attempting to modify existing permissions in the grant
          tables.

          mysql_setpermission also reads options from the [client] and
          [perl] groups in the .my.cnf file in your home directory, if the
          file exists.

          mysql_setpermission supports the following options:

          •   --help

              Display a help message and exit.

          •   --host=host_name

              Connect to the MariaDB server on the given host.

          •   --password=password

              The password to use when connecting to the server. Note that
              the password value is not optional for this option, unlike
              for other MariaDB programs.

              Specifying a password on the command line should be
              considered insecure. You can use an option file to avoid
              giving the password on the command line.

          •   --port=port_num

              The TCP/IP port number to use for the connection.

          •   --socket=path

              For connections to localhost, the Unix socket file to use.

          •   --user=user_name

              The MariaDB user name to use when connecting to the server.
