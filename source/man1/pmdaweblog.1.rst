   PMDAWEBLOG(1)            General Commands Manual           PMDAWEBLOG(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaweblog - performance metrics domain agent (PMDA) for Web
          server logs


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/pmdaweblog [-Cp] [-d domain] [-h helpfile]
          [-i port] [-l logfile] [-n idlesec] [-S num] [-t delay] [-u
          socket] [-U username] configfile


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaweblog is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA(3)) that
          scans Web server logs to extract metrics characterizing Web
          server activity.  These performance metrics are then made
          available through the infrastructure of the Performance Co-Pilot
          (PCP).

          The configfile specifies which Web servers are to be monitored,
          their associated access logs and error logs, and a regular-
          expression based scheme for extracting detailed information about
          each Web access.  This file is maintained as part of the PMDA
          installation and/or de-installation by the scripts Install and
          Remove in the directory $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog.  For more details,
          refer to the section below covering installation.

          Once started, pmdaweblog monitors a set of log files and in
          response to a request for information, will process any new
          information that has been appended to the log files, similar to a
          tail(1).  There is also periodic "catch up" to process new
          information from all log files, and a scheme to detect the
          rotation of log files.

          Like all other PMDAs, pmdaweblog is launched by pmcd(1) using
          command line options specified in $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH - the
          Install script will prompt for appropriate values for the command
          line options, and update $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH.

          A brief description of the pmdaweblog command line options
          follows:

          -C     Check the configuration and exit.

          -d domain
                 Specify the domain number.  It is absolutely crucial that
                 the performance metrics domain number specified here is
                 unique and consistent.  That is, domain should be
                 different for every PMDA on the one host, and the same
                 domain number should be used for the pmdaweblog PMDA on
                 all hosts.

                 For most installations, the default domain as encapsulated
                 in the file $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog/domain.h will suffice.
                 For alternate values, check $PCP_PMCDCONF_PATH for the
                 domain values already in use on this host, and the file
                 $PCP_VAR_DIR/pmns/stdpmid contains a repository of ``well
                 known'' domain assignments that probably should be
                 avoided.

          -h helpfile
                 Get the help text from the supplied helpfile rather than
                 from the default location.

          -i port
                 Communicate with pmcd(1) on the specified Internet port
                 (which may be a number or a name).

          -l logfile
                 Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
                 weblog.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
                 when pmdaweblog is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
                 the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output
                 is written to the standard error instead.

          -n idlesec
                 If a Web server log file has not been modified for idlesec
                 seconds, then the file will be closed and re-opened.  This
                 is the only way pmdaweblog can detect any asynchronous
                 rotation of the logs by Web server administrative scripts.
                 The default period is 20 seconds.  This value may be
                 changed dynamically using pmstore(1) to modify the value
                 of the performance metric web.config.check.

          -p     Communicate with pmcd(1) via a pipe.

          -S num Specify the maximum number of Web servers per sproc.  It
                 may be desirable (from a latency and load balancing
                 perspective) or necessary (due to file descriptor limits)
                 to delegate responsibility for scanning the Web server log
                 files to several sprocs.  pmdaweblog will ensure that each
                 sproc handles the log files for at most num Web servers.
                 The default value is 80 Web servers per sproc.

          -t delay
                 To avoid the need to scan a lot of information from the
                 Web server logs in response to a single request for
                 performance metrics, all log files will be checked at
                 least once every delay seconds.  The default is 15
                 seconds.  This value may by changed dynamically using
                 pmstore(1) to modify the value of the performance metric
                 web.config.catchup.

          -u socket
                 Communicate with pmcd(1) via the given Unix domain socket.

          -U     User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
                 the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
                 but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
                 used by default.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The PCP framework allows metrics to be collected on one host and
          monitored from another.  These hosts are referred to as collector
          and monitor hosts, respectively.  A host may be both a collector
          and a monitor.

          Collector hosts require the installation of the agent, while
          monitoring hosts require no agent installation at all.

          For collector hosts do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog
            # ./Install

          The installation procedure prompts for a default or non-default
          installation.  A default installation will search for known
          server configurations and automatically configure the PMDA for
          any server log files that are found.  A non-default installation
          will step through each server, prompting the user for other
          server configurations and arguments to pmdaweblog.  The end
          result of a collector installation is to build a configuration
          file that is passed to pmdaweblog via the configfile argument.

          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

            # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/weblog
            # ./Remove

          pmdaweblog is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The configuration file for the weblog PMDA is an ASCII file that
          can be easily modified.  Empty lines and lines beginning with '#'
          are ignored.  All other lines must be either a regular expression
          or server specification.

          Regular expressions, which are used on both the access and error
          log files, must be of the form:

            regex regexName regexp
          or

            regex_posix regexName ordering regexp_posix

          The regexName is a word which uniquely identifies the regular
          expression.  This is the reference used in the server
          specification.  The regexp for access logs is in the format
          described for regcmp(3).  The regexp_posix for access logs is in
          the format described for regcomp(3).  The argument ordering is
          explained below. The Posix form should be available on all
          platforms.

          The regular expression requires the specification of up to four
          arguments to be extracted from each line of a Web server access
          log, depending on the type of server. In the most common case
          there are two arguments representing the method and the size.

          For the non- Posix version, argument $0 should contain the
          method: GET, HEAD , POST or PUT.  The method PUT is treated as a
          synonym for POST, and anything else is categorized as OTHER.

          The second argument, $1, should contain the size of the request.
          A size of ``-'' or `` '' is treated as unknown.

          Argument $3 should contain the status code returned to the client
          browser and argument $4 should contain the status code returned
          to the server from a remote host.  These latter two arguments are
          used for caching servers and must be specified as a pair (or $3
          will be ignored). For further information on status codes, refer
          to the web site
          http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html .

          Some legal non- Posix regex expression specifications for
          monitoring an access log are:

            # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Access Logs
            regex CERN ] "([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)$1

            # pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in SYSLOG)
            regex SYSLOG_FTP ftpd[.*]: ([gp][-A-Za-z]+)$0( )$1

          There is 1 special types of access logs with the RegexName SQUID.
          This formats extract 4 parameters but since the Squid log file
          uses text-based status codes, it is handled as a special case.

          In the examples below, NS_PROXY parses the Netscape/W3C Common
          Extended Log Format and SQUID parses the default Squid Object
          Cache format log file.

            # pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs
            regex NS_PROXY ] "([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+)$0 .*" ([-0-9]+)$2 \
                 ([-0-9]+)$1 ([-0-9]+)$3

            # pattern for Squid Cache logs
            regex SQUID [0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ \
                 ([_A-Z]+)$3([0-9]+)$2 ([0-9]+)$1 ([A-Z]+)$0

          The regexp for the error logs does not require any arguments,
          only a match.  Some legal expressions are:

            # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs
            regex CERN_err .

            # pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
            regex SYSLOG_FTP_err FTP LOGIN FAILED

          If POSIX compliant regular expressions are used, additional
          information is required since the order of parameters cannot be
          specified in the regular expression.  For backwards
          compatibility, the common case of two parameters the order may be
          specified as method,size or size,method In the general case, the
          ordering is specified by one of the following methods:

          n1,n2,n3,n4
               where nX is a digit between 1 and 4. Each comma-seperated
               field represents (in order) the argument number for
               method,size,client_status,server_status

          -    Used for cases like the error logs where the content is
               ignored.

          As for the non- Posix format, the SQUID RegexName is treated as a
          special case to match the non-numerical status codes.

          Some legal Posix regex expression specifications for monitoring
          an access log are:

            # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access Logs
            regex_posix CERN method,size ][ \]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
                 [^"]*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)

            # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape, Apache etc Access Logs
            regex_posix CERN 1,2 ][ \]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
                 [^"]*" [-0-9]+ ([-0-9]+)

            # pattern for FTP Server access logs (normally in SYSLOG)
            regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP method,size ftpd[.*]: \
                 ([gp][-A-Za-z]+)( )

            # pattern for Netscape Proxy Server Extended Logs
            regex_posix NS_PROXY 1,3,2,4 ][ ]+"([A-Za-z][-A-Za-z]+) \
                 [^"]*" ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+) ([-0-9]+)

            # pattern for Squid Cache logs
            regex_posix SQUID 4,3,2,1 [0-9]+.[0-9]+[ ]+[0-9]+ \
                 [a-zA-Z0-9.]+ ([_A-Z]+)([0-9]+) ([0-9]+) ([A-Z]+)

            # pattern for CERN, NCSA, Netscape etc Error Logs
            regex_posix CERN_err - .

            # pattern for FTP Server error logs (normally in SYSLOG)
            regex_posix SYSLOG_FTP_err - FTP LOGIN FAILED

          A Web server can be specified using this syntax:

            server serverName on|off accessRegex accessFile errorRegex errorFile

          The serverName must be unique for each server, and is the name
          given to the instance for the associated performance metrics.
          See PMAPI(3) for a discussion of PCP instance domains.  The on or
          off flag indicates whether the server is to be monitored when the
          PMDA is installed.  This can altered dynamically using pmstore(1)
          for the metric web.perserver.watched, which has one instance for
          each Web server named in configfile.

          Two files are monitored for each Web server, the access and the
          error log.  Each file requires the name of a previously declared
          regular expression, and a file name.  The log files specified for
          each server do not have to exist when the weblog PMDA is
          installed.  The PMDA will continue to check for non-existent log
          files and open them when possible.  Some legal server
          specifications are:

            # Netscape Server on Port 80 at IP address 127.55.555.555
            server 127.55.555.555:80 on CERN /logs/access CERN_err /logs/errors

            # FTP Server.
            server ftpd on SYSLOG_FTP /var/log/messages SYSLOG_FTP_err /var/log/messages


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          Specifying regular expressions with an incorrect number of
          arguments, anything other than 2 for access logs, and none for
          error logs, may cause the PMDA to behave incorrectly and even
          crash. This is due to limitations in the interface of regex(3).

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
