   PMDAORACLE(1)            General Commands Manual           PMDAORACLE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaoracle - Oracle database PMDA


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaoracle is a Performance Co-Pilot PMDA which extracts live
          performance data from a running Oracle database.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdaoracle uses a configuration file from (in this order):
          •   /etc/pcpdbi.conf
          •   $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/oracle.conf
          •   ./oracle.conf

          This file can contain overridden values (Perl code) for the
          settings listed at the start of pmdaoracle.pl, for example:
          •   $username - username to connect to the database [default:
              'SYSTEM']
          •   $password - password to connect to the database [default:
              'manager']
          •   $host - host the database is running on [default:
              'localhost']
          •   $port - port the database is listening on [default: '1521']
          •   $os_user - operating system username (PMDA will run with the
              corresponding user id) [default: oracle]
          •   @sids - an array of $ORACLE_SID database identifiers
              [default: ('master')]

          In order to test your local settings, a simple script is provided
          that will connect and disconnect from the database - verifying
          fundamental configuration is in place before continuing on.  If
          the $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle/connect.pl script cannot connect, do
          not proceed with installation of the PMDA as it will be
          unsuccessful.  Correct your local settings first.

          Once this is setup, you can access the names and values for the
          oracle performance metrics by doing the following as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
              # ./Install

          To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/oracle
              # ./Remove

          pmdaoracle is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly. The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          By default, pmdaoracle will aggressively attempt to maintain
          persistent connections to Oracle to ensure timely responses to
          its queries, and will automatically re-connect if a connection
          drops.

          However, in certain circumstances this may be undesirable, so a
          manual pmStore(3) mechanism is provided to explicitly control
          disconnecting and reconnecting to an Oracle instance.  This can
          be used, for example, to ensure that pmdaoracle is not connected
          at shutdown, to ensure a clean Oracle shutdown process.

          The pmstore(1) command can be used to disconnect and reconnect.
          Using the individual instances of the oracle.control.connected
          metric, one can set the connection state to either up (1) or down
          (0).  Additionally, pminfo(1) can report on the current status of
          Oracle connections.

               # pminfo ‐f oracle.control.connected

               oracle.control.connected
                   inst [0 or "master"] value 1

               # pmstore oracle.control.connected 0
               oracle.control.connected inst [0 or "master"] old value=1 new value=0

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
