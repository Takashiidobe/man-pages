   PMDIFF(1)                General Commands Manual               PMDIFF(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdiff - compares archives and report significant differences


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdiff [-dzV?]  [-B starttime] [-E endtime] [-p precision] [-q
          thres] [-S starttime] [--skip-excluded] [--skip-missing] [-T
          endtime] [-x metric] [-X file] [-Z timezone] archive1 [archive2]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdiff compares the average values for every metric in either one
          or two sets of archives, in a given time window, for changes that
          are likely to be of interest when searching for performance
          regressions.

          The archive specifiers archive1 and archive2 may be comma-
          separated lists of names, each of which may be the base name of
          an archive or the name of a directory containing one or more
          archives. Each archive in the resulting set of archives must have
          been previously created using pmlogger(1).  The pmlogsummary(1)
          utility is used to obtain the average values used for comparison.

          There are two sorts of invocation of the tool: with either one or
          two sets of archives.

          In the first case, the only sensible command line requires use of
          all four time window arguments.  These are specified using the
          same time window format described in PCPIntro(1), and are
          -S/--start and -T/--finish for the start and end times of the
          first time window of interest in the archive set, and -B/--before
          and -E/--end for the start and end times of the second time
          window of interest.

          In the second case, with two sets of archives, the -B/--before
          and -E/--end options might be unnecessary.  This might be the
          case, for example, when comparing the same time window of two
          consecutive days (usually two separate sets of archives), or a
          time window on the same day of different weeks.

          In either case, pmdiff produces a sorted summary of those metrics
          in the specified window whose values have deviated the most from
          a minimal threshold.  The level of deviation is calculated by
          dividing the average value of each metric in both logs, and then
          calculating whether the ratio falls outside of a range considered
          normal.  This ratio can be adjusted using the -q/--threshold
          option, and by default it is 2 (i.e. report all metrics with
          average values that have more than doubled in the two time
          windows or more than halved in the two time windows).

          If the baseline value is zero and the comparison value is non-
          zero, the ratio is reported as ``|+|'' (infinitely large).  If
          the comparison value is zero and the baseline value is non-zero,
          the ratio is reported as ``|-|'' (infinitely small).

          Reported metrics are sorted in ascending ratio order.

          Should any metrics be present in one window but missing from the
          other, a diagnostic will be displayed listing each missing metric
          and the archive set from which it was missing.

          Metrics with counter semantics are converted to rates before
          being evaluated.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -d, --keep
               Debug mode, keep intermediate files.

          -B time, --begin=time
               Start time for the second time window.

          -E time, --end=time
               End time for the second time window.

          -p precision, --precision=precision
               Print all floating point numbers with precision digits after
               the decimal place.

          -q threshold, --threshold=threshold
               Change the threshold for interesting metrics, see above for
               more details.

          -S time, --start=time
               Start time of the first time window.

          -T time, --finish=time
               End time of the first time window.

          -V, --version
               Display version number and exit.

          -x metric
               Compare each metric in each archive set in the time windows
               specified to a given egrep(1) pattern, excluding those that
               match from the report output.

          -X file
               Allows a file to be specified which containing egrep(1)
               patterns which are applied to the metric names to optionally
               exclude some from the report.

          -z, --hostzone
               Use the local timezone from the given archive set.

          -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
               Changes the timezone in the archive labels to timezone in
               the format of the environment variable TZ as described in
               environ(7).

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.

          --skip-excluded
               Cull the list of names of metrics being excluded from the
               output.

          --skip-missing
               By default, pmdiff will report the names of any metrics that
               are in one archive set but not the other.  This option
               suppresses that reporting.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmlogger/<hostname>
               Default directory for PCP archives containing performance
               metric values collected from the host hostname.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
