NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          replace - a string-replacement utility


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          replace arguments


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The replace utility program changes strings in place in files or
          on the standard input.

          Invoke replace in one of the following ways:

              shell> replace from to [from to] ... -- file_name [file_name] ...
              shell> replace from to [from to] ... < file_name

          from represents a string to look for and to represents its
          replacement. There can be one or more pairs of strings.

          Use the -- option to indicate where the string-replacement list
          ends and the file names begin. In this case, any file named on
          the command line is modified in place, so you may want to make a
          copy of the original before converting it.  replace prints a
          message indicating which of the input files it actually modifies.

          If the -- option is not given, replace reads the standard input
          and writes to the standard output.

          replace uses a finite state machine to match longer strings
          first. It can be used to swap strings. For example, the following
          command swaps a and b in the given files, file1 and file2:

              shell> replace a b b a -- file1 file2 ...

          The replace program is used by msql2mysql. See msql2mysql(1).

          replace supports the following options.

          •   -?, -I

              Display a help message and exit.

          •   -#debug_options

              Enable debugging.

          •   -s

              Silent mode. Print less information what the program does.

          •   -v

              Verbose mode. Print more information about what the program
              does.

          •   -V

              Display version information and exit.
