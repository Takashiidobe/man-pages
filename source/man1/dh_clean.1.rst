   DH_CLEAN(1)                     Debhelper                    DH_CLEAN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_clean - clean up package build directories


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_clean [debhelper options] [-k] [-d] [-Xitem] [path ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_clean is a debhelper program that is responsible for cleaning
          up.  It should be the last step of the clean target and other
          debhelper commands generally assume that dh_clean will clean up
          after them.

          It removes the package build directories, and removes some other
          files including debian/files, and any detritus left behind by
          other debhelper commands. It also removes common files that
          should not appear in a Debian diff:
            #*# *~ DEADJOE *.orig *.rej *.SUMS TAGS .deps/* *.P *-stamp

          It does not run "make clean" to clean up after the build process.
          Use dh_auto_clean(1) to do things like that.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          debian/clean
              Can list other paths to be removed.

              Note that directories listed in this file must end with a
              trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
              removed as well.

              Supports substitution variables in compat 13 and later as
              documented in debhelper(7).


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -k, --keep
              This is deprecated, use dh_prep(1) instead.

              The option is removed in compat 12.

          -d, --dirs-only
              Only clean the package build directories, do not clean up any
              other files at all.

          -Xitem --exclude=item
              Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
              from being deleted, even if they would normally be deleted.
              You may use this option multiple times to build up a list of
              things to exclude.

          path ...
              Delete these paths too.

              Note that directories passed as arguments must end with a
              trailing slash.  Any content in these directories will be
              removed as well.
