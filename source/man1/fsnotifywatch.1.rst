   inotifywatch(1)          General Commands Manual         inotifywatch(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          inotifywatch, fsnotifywatch - gather filesystem access statistics
          using inotify or fanotify


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          inotifywatch [-hvzrPqf] [-e <event> ] [-t <seconds> ] [-a <event>
          ] [-d <event> ] <file> [ ... ]

          fsnotifywatch [-hvzrPqfIFS] [-e <event> ] [-t <seconds> ] [-a
          <event> ] [-d <event> ] <file> [ ... ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          inotifywatch listens for filesystem events using Linux's
          inotify(7) interface, then outputs a summary count of the events
          received on each file or directory.

          fsnotifywatch is similar to inotifywatch but it is using Linux's
          fanotify(7) interface by default. If explicitly sepcified, it
          uses the inotify(7) interface.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          inotifywatch and fsnotifywatch will output a table on standard
          out with one column for each type of event and one row for each
          watched file or directory.  The table will show the amount of
          times each event occurred for each watched file or directory.
          Output can be sorted by a particular event using the -a or -d
          options.

          Some diagnostic information will be output on standard error.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -h, --help
                 Output some helpful usage information.

          -v, --verbose
                 Output some extra information on standard error during
                 execution.

          @<file>
                 When watching a directory tree recursively, exclude the
                 specified file from being watched.  The file must be
                 specified with a relative or absolute path according to
                 whether a relative or absolute path is given for watched
                 directories.  If a specific path is explicitly both
                 included and excluded, it will always be watched.

                 Note: If you need to watch a directory or file whose name
                 starts with @, give the absolute path.

          --fromfile <file>
                 Read filenames to watch or exclude from a file, one
                 filename per line.  If filenames begin with @ they are
                 excluded as described above.  If <file> is `-', filenames
                 are read from standard input.  Use this option if you need
                 to watch too many files to pass in as command line
                 arguments.

          -z, --zero
                 Output table rows and columns even if all elements are
                 zero.  By default, rows and columns are only output if
                 they contain non-zero elements.  Using this option when
                 watching for every event on a lot of files can result in a
                 lot of output!

          --exclude <pattern>
                 Do not process any events for the subset of files whose
                 filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression,
                 case sensitive.

          --excludei <pattern>
                 Do not process any events for the subset of files whose
                 filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression,
                 case insensitive.

          --include <pattern>
                 Process events only for the subset of files whose
                 filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression,
                 case sensitive.

          --includei <pattern>
                 Process events only for the subset of files whose
                 filenames match the specified POSIX regular expression,
                 case insensitive.

          -r, --recursive
                 Watch all subdirectories of any directories passed as
                 arguments.  Watches will be set up recursively to an
                 unlimited depth.  Symbolic links are not traversed.  If
                 new directories are created within watched directories
                 they will automatically be watched.

                 Warning: If you use this option while watching the root
                 directory of a large tree, it may take quite a while until
                 all inotify watches are established, and events will not
                 be received in this time.  Also, since one inotify watch
                 will be established per subdirectory, it is possible that
                 the maximum amount of inotify watches per user will be
                 reached.  The default maximum is 8192; it can be increased
                 by writing to /proc/sys/fs/inotify/max_user_watches.

          -P, --no-dereference
                 Do not follow symlinks.

          -t <seconds>, --timeout <seconds>
                 Listen only for the specified amount of seconds.  If not
                 specified, inotifywatch will gather statistics until
                 receiving an interrupt signal by (for example) pressing
                 CONTROL-C at the console.

          -e <event>, --event <event>
                 Listen for specific event(s) only.  The events which can
                 be listened for are listed in the EVENTS section.  This
                 option can be specified more than once.  If omitted, all
                 events are listened for.

          -a <event>, --ascending <event>
                 Sort output ascending by event counts for the specified
                 event.  Sortable events include `total' and all the events
                 listed in the EVENTS section except `move' and `close'
                 (you must use `moved_to', `moved_from', `close_write' or
                 `close_nowrite' instead).  The default is to sort
                 descending by `total'.

          -d <event>, --descending <event>
                 Sort output descending by event counts for the specified
                 event.  Sortable events include `total' and all the events
                 listed in the EVENTS section except `move' and `close'
                 (you must use `moved_to', `moved_from', `close_write' or
                 `close_nowrite' instead).  The default is to sort
                 descending by `total'.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          0      The program executed successfully.

          1      An error occurred in execution of the program.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The following events are valid for use with the -e option:

          access A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 read from.

          modify A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 written to.

          attrib The metadata of a watched file or a file within a watched
                 directory was modified.  This includes timestamps, file
                 permissions, extended attributes etc.

          close_write
                 A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 closed, after being opened in writeable mode.  This does
                 not necessarily imply the file was written to.

          close_nowrite
                 A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 closed, after being opened in read-only mode.

          close  A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 closed, regardless of how it was opened.  Note that this
                 is actually implemented simply by listening for both
                 close_write and close_nowrite, hence all close events
                 received will be output as one of these, not CLOSE.

          open   A watched file or a file within a watched directory was
                 opened.

          moved_to
                 A file or directory was moved into a watched directory.
                 This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from
                 and to the same directory.

          moved_from
                 A file or directory was moved from a watched directory.
                 This event occurs even if the file is simply moved from
                 and to the same directory.

          move   A file or directory was moved from or to a watched
                 directory.  Note that this is actually implemented simply
                 by listening for both moved_to and moved_from, hence all
                 close events received will be output as one or both of
                 these, not MOVE.

          move_self
                 A watched file or directory was moved. After this event,
                 the file or directory is no longer being watched.

          create A file or directory was created within a watched
                 directory.

          delete A file or directory within a watched directory was
                 deleted.

          delete_self
                 A watched file or directory was deleted.  After this event
                 the file or directory is no longer being watched.  Note
                 that this event can occur even if it is not explicitly
                 being listened for.

          unmount
                 The filesystem on which a watched file or directory
                 resides was unmounted.  After this event the file or
                 directory is no longer being watched.  Note that this
                 event can occur even if it is not explicitly being
                 listened to.

      fsnotifywatch
          The following additional options are available:

          -I, --inotify
                 Watch using inotify.

          -F, --fanotify
                 Watch using fanotify (default).  fanotify support for
                 reporting events with inotify compatible information was
                 added in kernel v5.9.  With older kernels the command will
                 fail.  As of kernel v5.12, fanotify requires admin
                 privileges.

          -S, --filesystem
                 Watch entire filesystem of any directories passed as
                 arguments using fanotify.

-------------------------------------------------------

::

          When using inotifywatch, the filename that is outputted is not
          guaranteed to be up to date after a move because it is the inode
          that is being monitored. Additionally, none of the observed
          operations are guaranteed to have been performed on the filename
          inotifywatch was instructed to monitor in cases when the file is
          known by several names in the filesystem.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          There are race conditions in the recursive directory watching
          code which can cause events to be missed if they occur in a
          directory immediately after that directory is created.  This is
          probably not fixable.

          It is assumed the inotify event queue will never overflow.
