---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp2xlsx is a customizable performance metrics exporter tool from
          PCP to XLSX.  Any available performance metric, live or archived,
          system and/or application, can be selected for exporting using
          either command line arguments or a configuration file.

          pcp2xlsx is a close relative of pmrep(1).  Refer to pmrep(1) for
          the metricspec description accepted on pcp2xlsx command line.
          See pmrep.conf(5) for description of the pcp2xlsx.conf
          configuration file overall syntax.  This page describes pcp2xlsx
          specific options and configuration file differences with
          pmrep.conf(5).  pmrep(1) also lists some usage examples of which
          most are applicable with pcp2xlsx as well.

          Only the command line options listed on this page are supported,
          other options recognized by pmrep(1) are not supported.

          Options via environment values (see pmGetOptions(3)) override the
          corresponding built-in default values (if any).  Configuration
          file options override the corresponding environment variables (if
          any).  Command line options override the corresponding
          configuration file options (if any).


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pcp2xlsx uses a configuration file with overall syntax described
          in pmrep.conf(5).  The following options are common with
          pmrep.conf: version, source, speclocal, derived, header, globals,
          samples, interval, type, type_prefer, ignore_incompat,
          names_change, instances, omit_flat, include_labels, precision,
          precision_force, count_scale, count_scale_force, space_scale,
          space_scale_force, time_scale, time_scale_force.  The output
          option is recognized but ignored for pmrep.conf compatibility.

          There are no pcp2xlsx specific options.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -0 precision, --precision-force=precision
               Like -P but this option will override per-metric
               specifications.

          -4 action, --names-change=action
               Specify which action to take on receiving a metric names
               change event during sampling.  These events occur when a
               PMDA discovers new metrics sometime after starting up, and
               informs running client tools like pcp2xlsx.  Valid values
               for action are update (refresh metrics being sampled),
               ignore (do nothing - the default behaviour) and abort (exit
               the program if such an event happens).

          -5, --ignore-unknown
               Silently ignore any metric name that cannot be resolved.  At
               least one metric must be found for the tool to start.

          -a archive, --archive=archive
               Performance metric values are retrieved from the set of
               Performance Co-Pilot (PCP) archive log files identified by
               the archive argument, which is a comma-separated list of
               names, each of which may be the base name of an archive or
               the name of a directory containing one or more archives.

          -A align, --align=align
               Force the initial sample to be aligned on the boundary of a
               natural time unit align.  Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a
               complete description of the syntax for align.

          --archive-folio=folio
               Read metric source archives from the PCP archive folio
               created by tools like pmchart(1) or, less often, manually
               with mkaf(1).

          -b scale, --space-scale=scale
               Unit/scale for space (byte) metrics, possible values include
               bytes, Kbytes, KB, Mbytes, MB, and so forth.  This option
               will not override possible per-metric specifications.  See
               also pmParseUnitsStr(3).

          -B scale, --space-scale-force=scale
               Like -b but this option will override per-metric
               specifications.

          -c config, --config=config
               Specify the config file or directory to use.  In case config
               is a directory all files under it ending .conf will be
               included.  The default is the first found of:
               ./pcp2xlsx.conf, $HOME/.pcp2xlsx.conf,
               $HOME/pcp/pcp2xlsx.conf, and $PCP_SYSCONF_DIR/pcp2xlsx.conf.
               For details, see the above section and pmrep.conf(5).

          --container=container
               Fetch performance metrics from the specified container,
               either local or remote (see -h).

          -C, --check
               Exit before reporting any values, but after parsing the
               configuration and metrics and printing possible headers.

          --daemonize
               Daemonize on startup.

          -e derived, --derived=derived
               Specify derived performance metrics.  If derived starts with
               a slash (``/'') or with a dot (``.'') it will be interpreted
               as a derived metrics configuration file, otherwise it will
               be interpreted as comma- or semicolon-separated derived
               metric expressions.  For details see pmLoadDerivedConfig(3)
               and pmRegisterDerived(3).

          -G, --no-globals
               Do not include global metrics in reporting (see
               pmrep.conf(5)).

          -f format, --timestamp-format=format
               Use the format string for formatting the timestamp.  The
               format will be used with Python's datetime.strftime method
               which is mostly the same as that described in strftime(3).
               The default is %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.

          -F outfile, --output-file=outfile
               Specify the output file outfile.

          -h host, --host=host
               Fetch performance metrics from pmcd(1) on host, rather than
               from the default localhost.

          -H, --no-header
               Do not print any headers.

          -i instances, --instances=instances
               Retrieve and report only the specified metric instances from
               currently present metric instances.  By default all current
               instances are reported.

               Refer to pmrep(1) for complete description of this option.

          -I, --ignore-incompat
               Ignore incompatible metrics.  By default incompatible
               metrics (that is, their type is unsupported or they cannot
               be scaled as requested) will cause pcp2xlsx to terminate
               with an error message.  With this option all incompatible
               metrics are silently omitted from reporting.  This may be
               especially useful when requesting non-leaf nodes of the PMNS
               tree for reporting.

          -K spec, --spec-local=spec
               When fetching metrics from a local context (see -L), the -K
               option may be used to control the DSO PMDAs that should be
               made accessible.  The spec argument conforms to the syntax
               described in pmSpecLocalPMDA(3).  More than one -K option
               may be used.

          -L, --local-PMDA
               Use a local context to collect metrics from DSO PMDAs on the
               local host without PMCD.  See also -K.

          -m, --include-labels
               Include metric labels in the output.

          -O origin, --origin=origin
               When reporting archived metrics, start reporting at origin
               within the time window (see -S and -T).  Refer to
               PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the syntax for
               origin.

          -P precision, --precision=precision
               Use precision for numeric non-integer output values.  The
               default is to use 3 decimal places (when applicable).  This
               option will not override possible per-metric specifications.

          -q scale, --count-scale=scale
               Unit/scale for count metrics, possible values include count
               x 10^-1, count, count x 10, count x 10^2, and so forth from
               10^-8 to 10^7.  (These values are currently space-
               sensitive.)  This option will not override possible per-
               metric specifications.  See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).

          -Q scale, --count-scale-force=scale
               Like -q but this option will override per-metric
               specifications.

          -r, --raw
               Output raw metric values, do not convert cumulative counters
               to rates.  This option will override possible per-metric
               specifications.

          -R, --raw-prefer
               Like -r but this option will not override per-metric
               specifications.

          -s samples, --samples=samples
               The samples argument defines the number of samples to be
               retrieved and reported.  If samples is 0 or -s is not
               specified, pcp2xlsx will sample and report continuously (in
               real time mode) or until the end of the set of PCP archives
               (in archive mode).  See also -T.

          -S starttime, --start=starttime
               When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
               restricted to those records logged at or after starttime.
               Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
               syntax for starttime.

          -t interval, --interval=interval
               Set the reporting interval to something other than the
               default 1 second.  The interval argument follows the syntax
               described in PCPIntro(1), and in the simplest form may be an
               unsigned integer (the implied units in this case are
               seconds).  See also the -T option.

          -T endtime, --finish=endtime
               When reporting archived metrics, the report will be
               restricted to those records logged before or at endtime.
               Refer to PCPIntro(1) for a complete description of the
               syntax for endtime.

               When used to define the runtime before pcp2xlsx will exit,
               if no samples is given (see -s) then the number of reported
               samples depends on interval (see -t).  If samples is given
               then interval will be adjusted to allow reporting of samples
               during runtime.  In case all of -T, -s, and -t are given,
               endtime determines the actual time pcp2xlsx will run.

          -v, --omit-flat
               Report only set-valued metrics with instances (e.g.
               disk.dev.read) and omit single-valued ``flat'' metrics
               without instances (e.g.  kernel.all.sysfork).  See -i and
               -I.

          -V, --version
               Display version number and exit.

          -y scale, --time-scale=scale
               Unit/scale for time metrics, possible values include
               nanosec, ns, microsec, us, millisec, ms, and so forth up to
               hour, hr.  This option will not override possible per-metric
               specifications.  See also pmParseUnitsStr(3).

          -Y scale, --time-scale-force=scale
               Like -y but this option will override per-metric
               specifications.

          -z, --hostzone
               Use the local timezone of the host that is the source of the
               performance metrics, as identified by either the -h or the
               -a options.  The default is to use the timezone of the local
               host.

          -Z timezone, --timezone=timezone
               Use timezone for the date and time.  Timezone is in the
               format of the environment variable TZ as described in
               environ(7).  Note that when including a timezone string in
               output, ISO 8601 -style UTC offsets are used (so something
               like -Z EST+5 will become UTC-5).

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
