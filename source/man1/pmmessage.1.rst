   PMQUERY(1)               General Commands Manual              PMQUERY(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmconfirm, pmmessage, pmquery - general purpose dialog box


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmconfirm [-c] [-b button-name] [-B default-button-name] [-t
          string] [-file filename] [-icon icontype] [-font font] [-header
          titlebar-string] [-useslider] [-noslider] [-noframe] [-exclusive]

          pmmessage [-buttons label1[:value1][,label2[:value2][,...]]]
          [-center] [-nearmouse] [-default button] [-file filename]
          [-print] [-timeout sec] message...

          pmquery [-input] [all above options...]  [message...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmquery provides a command-line-option compatible implementation
          of the xconfirm and xmessage tools, using a look-and-feel that is
          consistent with pmchart.  Several extensions to the functionality
          of the original tools have been made, in order to improve their
          specific utility for pmchart, but wherever possible the original
          semantics remain.

          pmconfirm displays a line of text for each -t option specified
          (or a file when the -file option is used), and a button for each
          -b option specified.  When one of the buttons is pressed, the
          label of that button is written to pmquery's standard output.
          This provides a means of communication/feedback from within shell
          scripts and a means to display useful information to a user from
          an application.

          pmmessage displays a window containing a message from the command
          line, a file, or standard input.  It additionally allows buttons
          to be associated with an exit status, and only optionally will
          write the label of the button to standard output.

          pmquery extends the above tools to additionally support limited
          user input, as free form text.  In this -input mode, any text
          entered will be output when the default button is pressed.  A
          default text can be entered using the same mechanisms as the
          other tools.

          Command line options are available to specify font style, frame
          style, modality and one of several different icons to be
          presented for tailored visual feedback to the user.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -c, -center
               Center the window on the display.

          -nearmouse
               Pop up the window near the mouse cursor.

          -b button-name
               Displays a button with the label button-name.  If button-
               name is the empty string, the button in that position is not
               displayed.  If no -b options are present, the default is a
               button with the label Continue.  The exit status associated
               with button-name is zero.

          -B button-name
               Displays a button with the label button-name and specifies
               it as the button to be activated when enter is pressed.  The
               exit status associated with button-name is zero.

          -buttons button,button,...
               This option will create one button for each comma-separated
               button option.  Each button consists of a label optionally
               followed by a colon and an exit value.  The exit value will
               be returned if that button is selected.  The default exit
               value is 100 plus the button number.  Buttons are numbered
               from the left starting with one.

          -default label
               Defines the button with a matching label to be the default.
               If not specified there is no default.  The corresponding
               resource is defaultButton.  Pressing Return anywhere in the
               xmessage window will activate the default button.  The
               default button has a wider border than the others.

          -t message
               Displays message.  Any number of strings can be listed on
               the command line (each must be preceded with the -t option).

          -file filename
               Displays the file filename.  All -t options will be ignored.
               A filename of `-' reads from standard input.

          -icon icontype
               Displays the icon icontype where icontype is one of: info,
               error, question, warning, critical.  action is also accepted
               as a synonym for error for backward compatibility.  pmquery
               introduces the additional archive and host icon types as
               well as the original xconfirm types listed earlier.

          -font fontname
               Use fontname as the font.  This option is only available
               when using the X Window System.

          -header string
               Use string as the window title.

          -print
               This causes the program to write the label of the button
               pressed to standard output.  It is the default behaviour for
               pmconfirm and pmquery.

          -noprint
               This causes the program to not write the label of the button
               pressed to standard output.  It is the default behaviour for
               pmmessage.

          -geometry geometry-string
               This provides the tool with an X-compatible geometry string
               specification.  This option is only available when using the
               X Window System.

          -useslider
               When displaying a file, always use a slider instead of
               determining automatically whether a slider is necessary.

          -noslider
               Do not create a slider, and clip text to the window size,
               instead of determining automatically whether a slider is
               necessary..

          -noframe
               Do not display a frame around the contents.

          -exclusive
               Grab the keyboard/pointer and do not allow further input
               until a button is pressed.

          -timeout secs
               Exit with status 0 after secs seconds if the user has not
               clicked on a button yet.  The corresponding resource is
               timeout.

          -?, -h, -help
               Display usage message and exit.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following shell script will display a window with an
          information icon, asking the user a yes or no question with "Yes"
          as the default.

           #! /bin/sh
           case `pmquery -t "Really power down?" -b No -B Yes -icon question
           in
             Yes) shutdown;;
             No) ;;
           esac

          A second example, which prompts for a hostname then starts a
          terminal with an ssh session connected to the requested host.

           #! /bin/sh
           host=`pmquery -input -icon host -b Cancel -B OK \
                         -header "Remote Terminal - Secure Shell"
           [ "$host" = "Cancel" -o -z "$host" ] && exit
           gnome-terminal -e "ssh $host"


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmquery is an excellent choice of utility for the
          PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG Performance Co-Pilot configuration parameter
          (refer to pcp.conf(5) for details).

          Note that PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG will be automatically set to pmquery
          inside tools like pmchart, unless PCP_XCONFIRM_PROG is already
          set in the environment.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If it detects an error, pmquery always returns 1, so this value
          should not be associated with a button.  Unless -button option
          has not been used, the return code will be zero on success.
