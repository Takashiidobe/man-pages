   PMDAPODMAN(1)            General Commands Manual           PMDAPODMAN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdapodman - podman container performance metrics domain agent
          (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman/pmdapodman [-d domain] [-l logfile]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          podman(1) is a utility for managing pods, containers and
          container images, following the container pod concept popularized
          by Kubernetes.  pmdapodman is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent
          (PMDA) which extracts performance metrics describing the state of
          containers and pods managed by podman.

          The podman PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
          individual containers and groups of containers, called pods.

          A brief description of the pmdapodman command line options
          follows:

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               podman.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
               when pmdapodman is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the
               log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
               written to the standard error instead.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The podman PMDA is installed and available by default on Linux.
          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
               # ./Remove

          If you want to establish access to the names, help text and
          values for the podman performance metrics once more, after
          removal, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/podman
               # ./Install

          pmdapodman is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.

                 default log file for error messages and other information
                 from pmdapodman


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
