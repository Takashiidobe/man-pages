   GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1)             Git Manual             GIT-FAST-EXPORT(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-fast-export - Git data exporter


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git fast-export [<options>] | git fast-import


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This program dumps the given revisions in a form suitable to be
          piped into git fast-import.

          You can use it as a human-readable bundle replacement (see
          git-bundle(1)), or as a format that can be edited before being
          fed to git fast-import in order to do history rewrites (an
          ability relied on by tools like git filter-repo).


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --progress=<n>
              Insert progress statements every <n> objects, to be shown by
              git fast-import during import.

          --signed-tags=(verbatim|warn|warn-strip|strip|abort)
              Specify how to handle signed tags. Since any transformation
              after the export can change the tag names (which can also
              happen when excluding revisions) the signatures will not
              match.

              When asking to abort (which is the default), this program
              will die when encountering a signed tag. With strip, the tags
              will silently be made unsigned, with warn-strip they will be
              made unsigned but a warning will be displayed, with verbatim,
              they will be silently exported and with warn, they will be
              exported, but you will see a warning.

          --tag-of-filtered-object=(abort|drop|rewrite)
              Specify how to handle tags whose tagged object is filtered
              out. Since revisions and files to export can be limited by
              path, tagged objects may be filtered completely.

              When asking to abort (which is the default), this program
              will die when encountering such a tag. With drop it will omit
              such tags from the output. With rewrite, if the tagged object
              is a commit, it will rewrite the tag to tag an ancestor
              commit (via parent rewriting; see git-rev-list(1))

          -M, -C
              Perform move and/or copy detection, as described in the
              git-diff(1) manual page, and use it to generate rename and
              copy commands in the output dump.

              Note that earlier versions of this command did not complain
              and produced incorrect results if you gave these options.

          --export-marks=<file>
              Dumps the internal marks table to <file> when complete. Marks
              are written one per line as :markid SHA-1. Only marks for
              revisions are dumped; marks for blobs are ignored. Backends
              can use this file to validate imports after they have been
              completed, or to save the marks table across incremental
              runs. As <file> is only opened and truncated at completion,
              the same path can also be safely given to --import-marks. The
              file will not be written if no new object has been
              marked/exported.

          --import-marks=<file>
              Before processing any input, load the marks specified in
              <file>. The input file must exist, must be readable, and must
              use the same format as produced by --export-marks.

          --mark-tags
              In addition to labelling blobs and commits with mark ids,
              also label tags. This is useful in conjunction with
              --export-marks and --import-marks, and is also useful (and
              necessary) for exporting of nested tags. It does not hurt
              other cases and would be the default, but many fast-import
              frontends are not prepared to accept tags with mark
              identifiers.

              Any commits (or tags) that have already been marked will not
              be exported again. If the backend uses a similar
              --import-marks file, this allows for incremental
              bidirectional exporting of the repository by keeping the
              marks the same across runs.

          --fake-missing-tagger
              Some old repositories have tags without a tagger. The
              fast-import protocol was pretty strict about that, and did
              not allow that. So fake a tagger to be able to fast-import
              the output.

          --use-done-feature
              Start the stream with a feature done stanza, and terminate it
              with a done command.

          --no-data
              Skip output of blob objects and instead refer to blobs via
              their original SHA-1 hash. This is useful when rewriting the
              directory structure or history of a repository without
              touching the contents of individual files. Note that the
              resulting stream can only be used by a repository which
              already contains the necessary objects.

          --full-tree
              This option will cause fast-export to issue a "deleteall"
              directive for each commit followed by a full list of all
              files in the commit (as opposed to just listing the files
              which are different from the commit’s first parent).

          --anonymize
              Anonymize the contents of the repository while still
              retaining the shape of the history and stored tree. See the
              section on ANONYMIZING below.

          --anonymize-map=<from>[:<to>]
              Convert token <from> to <to> in the anonymized output. If
              <to> is omitted, map <from> to itself (i.e., do not anonymize
              it). See the section on ANONYMIZING below.

          --reference-excluded-parents
              By default, running a command such as git fast-export
              master~5..master will not include the commit master~5 and
              will make master~4 no longer have master~5 as a parent
              (though both the old master~4 and new master~4 will have all
              the same files). Use --reference-excluded-parents to instead
              have the stream refer to commits in the excluded range of
              history by their sha1sum. Note that the resulting stream can
              only be used by a repository which already contains the
              necessary parent commits.

          --show-original-ids
              Add an extra directive to the output for commits and blobs,
              original-oid <SHA1SUM>. While such directives will likely be
              ignored by importers such as git-fast-import, it may be
              useful for intermediary filters (e.g. for rewriting commit
              messages which refer to older commits, or for stripping blobs
              by id).

          --reencode=(yes|no|abort)
              Specify how to handle encoding header in commit objects. When
              asking to abort (which is the default), this program will die
              when encountering such a commit object. With yes, the commit
              message will be re-encoded into UTF-8. With no, the original
              encoding will be preserved.

          --refspec
              Apply the specified refspec to each ref exported. Multiple of
              them can be specified.

          [<git-rev-list-args>...]
              A list of arguments, acceptable to git rev-parse and git
              rev-list, that specifies the specific objects and references
              to export. For example, master~10..master causes the current
              master reference to be exported along with all objects added
              since its 10th ancestor commit and (unless the
              --reference-excluded-parents option is specified) all files
              common to master~9 and master~10.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

              $ git fast-export --all | (cd /empty/repository && git fast-import)

          This will export the whole repository and import it into the
          existing empty repository. Except for reencoding commits that are
          not in UTF-8, it would be a one-to-one mirror.

              $ git fast-export master~5..master |
                      sed "s|refs/heads/master|refs/heads/other|" |
                      git fast-import

          This makes a new branch called other from master~5..master (i.e.
          if master has linear history, it will take the last 5 commits).

          Note that this assumes that none of the blobs and commit messages
          referenced by that revision range contains the string
          refs/heads/master.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If the --anonymize option is given, git will attempt to remove
          all identifying information from the repository while still
          retaining enough of the original tree and history patterns to
          reproduce some bugs. The goal is that a git bug which is found on
          a private repository will persist in the anonymized repository,
          and the latter can be shared with git developers to help solve
          the bug.

          With this option, git will replace all refnames, paths, blob
          contents, commit and tag messages, names, and email addresses in
          the output with anonymized data. Two instances of the same string
          will be replaced equivalently (e.g., two commits with the same
          author will have the same anonymized author in the output, but
          bear no resemblance to the original author string). The
          relationship between commits, branches, and tags is retained, as
          well as the commit timestamps (but the commit messages and
          refnames bear no resemblance to the originals). The relative
          makeup of the tree is retained (e.g., if you have a root tree
          with 10 files and 3 trees, so will the output), but their names
          and the contents of the files will be replaced.

          If you think you have found a git bug, you can start by exporting
          an anonymized stream of the whole repository:

              $ git fast-export --anonymize --all >anon-stream

          Then confirm that the bug persists in a repository created from
          that stream (many bugs will not, as they really do depend on the
          exact repository contents):

              $ git init anon-repo
              $ cd anon-repo
              $ git fast-import <../anon-stream
              $ ... test your bug ...

          If the anonymized repository shows the bug, it may be worth
          sharing anon-stream along with a regular bug report. Note that
          the anonymized stream compresses very well, so gzipping it is
          encouraged. If you want to examine the stream to see that it does
          not contain any private data, you can peruse it directly before
          sending. You may also want to try:

              $ perl -pe 's/\d+/X/g' <anon-stream | sort -u | less

          which shows all of the unique lines (with numbers converted to
          "X", to collapse "User 0", "User 1", etc into "User X"). This
          produces a much smaller output, and it is usually easy to quickly
          confirm that there is no private data in the stream.

          Reproducing some bugs may require referencing particular commits
          or paths, which becomes challenging after refnames and paths have
          been anonymized. You can ask for a particular token to be left
          as-is or mapped to a new value. For example, if you have a bug
          which reproduces with git rev-list sensitive -- secret.c, you can
          run:

              $ git fast-export --anonymize --all \
                    --anonymize-map=sensitive:foo \
                    --anonymize-map=secret.c:bar.c \
                    >stream

          After importing the stream, you can then run git rev-list foo --
          bar.c in the anonymized repository.

          Note that paths and refnames are split into tokens at slash
          boundaries. The command above would anonymize subdir/secret.c as
          something like path123/bar.c; you could then search for bar.c in
          the anonymized repository to determine the final pathname.

          To make referencing the final pathname simpler, you can map each
          path component; so if you also anonymize subdir to publicdir,
          then the final pathname would be publicdir/bar.c.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Since git fast-import cannot tag trees, you will not be able to
          export the linux.git repository completely, as it contains a tag
          referencing a tree instead of a commit.
