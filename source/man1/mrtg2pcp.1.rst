   MRTG2PCP(1)              General Commands Manual             MRTG2PCP(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          mrtg2pcp - import MRTG data and create a PCP archive


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mrtg2pcp hostname devname timezone infile outfile


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          mrtg2pcp is intended to read an MRTG log file as created by
          mrtg(1) and translate this into a Performance Co-Pilot (PCP)
          archive with the basename outfile.  The hostname, devname, and
          timezone arguments specify information about the system for which
          the statistics were gathered.

          The resultant PCP achive may be used with all PCP client tools to
          graph subsets of the data using pmchart(1), perform data
          reduction and reporting, filter with the PCP inference engine
          pmie(1), etc.

          A series of physical files will be created with the prefix
          outfile.  These are outfile.0 (the performance data),
          outfile.meta (the metadata that describes the performance data)
          and outfile.index (a temporal index to improve efficiency of
          replay operations for the archive).  If any of these files exists
          already, then mrtg2pcp will not overwrite them and will exit with
          an error message of the form

          __pmLogNewFile: ``blah.0'' already exists, not over-written

          mrtg2pcp is a Perl script that uses the PCP::LogImport Perl
          wrapper around the PCP libpcp_import library, and as such could
          be used as an example to develop new tools to import other types
          of performance data and create PCP archives.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          mrtg(1), pmchart(1), pmie(1), pmlogger(1), LOGIMPORT(3) and
          PCP::LogImport(3).
