   CHSH(1)                       User Commands                      CHSH(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          chsh - change login shell


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          chsh [options] [LOGIN]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The chsh command changes the user login shell. This determines
          the name of the user's initial login command. A normal user may
          only change the login shell for her own account; the superuser
          may change the login shell for any account.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The options which apply to the chsh command are:

          -h, --help
              Display help message and exit.

          -R, --root CHROOT_DIR
              Apply changes in the CHROOT_DIR directory and use the
              configuration files from the CHROOT_DIR directory.

          -s, --shell SHELL
              The name of the user's new login shell. Setting this field to
              blank causes the system to select the default login shell.

          If the -s option is not selected, chsh operates in an interactive
          fashion, prompting the user with the current login shell. Enter
          the new value to change the shell, or leave the line blank to use
          the current one. The current shell is displayed between a pair of
          [ ] marks.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          The only restriction placed on the login shell is that the
          command name must be listed in /etc/shells, unless the invoker is
          the superuser, and then any value may be added. An account with a
          restricted login shell may not change her login shell. For this
          reason, placing /bin/rsh in /etc/shells is discouraged since
          accidentally changing to a restricted shell would prevent the
          user from ever changing her login shell back to its original
          value.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          /etc/passwd
              User account information.

          /etc/shells
              List of valid login shells.

          /etc/login.defs
              Shadow password suite configuration.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          chfn(1), login.defs(5), passwd(5).
