   TELNET-PROBE(1)          General Commands Manual         TELNET-PROBE(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          telnet-probe - lightweight telnet-like port probe


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_BINADM_DIR/telnet-probe [-cv?]  host port


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          telnet-probe allows the pmdashping(1) daemons to establish
          connections to arbitrary local and remote service-providing
          daemons so that response time and service availability
          information can be obtained.

          The required host and port number arguments have the same meaning
          as their telnet(1) equivalents.

          The -c option causes telnet-probe to perform a connect(2) only.
          This skips the read(2) and write(2) exercise that would otherwise
          be done after connecting (see below).

          Once the telnet connection has been established, telnet-probe
          reads from stdin until end-of-file, and writes all the input data
          to the telnet connection.  Next, telnet-probe will read from the
          telnet connection until end-of-file, discarding whatever data it
          receives.  Then telnet-probe exits.

          To operate successfully, the input passed via telnet-probe to the
          remote service must be sufficient to cause the remote service to
          close the connection when the last line of input has been
          processed, e.g. ending with ``quit'' when probing SMTP on port
          25.

          By default telnet-probe will not produce any output, unless there
          is an error in which case a diagnostic message can be displayed
          (in verbose mode only) and the exit status will be non-zero
          indicating a failure.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -c   Connect only, do not read or write.

          -v   Enable verbose mode.

          -?   Display usage message and exit.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If telnet-probe succeeds, then 0 will be returned.  If the
          attempt to establish a connection fails or is terminated, then a
          non-zero exit status is returned.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          PCPIntro(1), pmdashping(1), pmie(1), telnet(1), connect(2),
          read(2) and write(2).
