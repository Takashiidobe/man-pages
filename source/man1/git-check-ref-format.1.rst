NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          git-check-ref-format - Ensures that a reference name is well
          formed


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          git check-ref-format [--normalize]
                 [--[no-]allow-onelevel] [--refspec-pattern]
                 <refname>
          git check-ref-format --branch <branchname-shorthand>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Checks if a given refname is acceptable, and exits with a
          non-zero status if it is not.

          A reference is used in Git to specify branches and tags. A branch
          head is stored in the refs/heads hierarchy, while a tag is stored
          in the refs/tags hierarchy of the ref namespace (typically in
          $GIT_DIR/refs/heads and $GIT_DIR/refs/tags directories or, as
          entries in file $GIT_DIR/packed-refs if refs are packed by git
          gc).

          Git imposes the following rules on how references are named:

           1. They can include slash / for hierarchical (directory)
              grouping, but no slash-separated component can begin with a
              dot .  or end with the sequence .lock.

           2. They must contain at least one /. This enforces the presence
              of a category like heads/, tags/ etc. but the actual names
              are not restricted. If the --allow-onelevel option is used,
              this rule is waived.

           3. They cannot have two consecutive dots ..  anywhere.

           4. They cannot have ASCII control characters (i.e. bytes whose
              values are lower than \040, or \177 DEL), space, tilde ~,
              caret ^, or colon : anywhere.

           5. They cannot have question-mark ?, asterisk *, or open bracket
              [ anywhere. See the --refspec-pattern option below for an
              exception to this rule.

           6. They cannot begin or end with a slash / or contain multiple
              consecutive slashes (see the --normalize option below for an
              exception to this rule)

           7. They cannot end with a dot ..

           8. They cannot contain a sequence @{.

           9. They cannot be the single character @.

          10. They cannot contain a \.

          These rules make it easy for shell script based tools to parse
          reference names, pathname expansion by the shell when a reference
          name is used unquoted (by mistake), and also avoid ambiguities in
          certain reference name expressions (see gitrevisions(7)):

           1. A double-dot ..  is often used as in ref1..ref2, and in some
              contexts this notation means ^ref1 ref2 (i.e. not in ref1 and
              in ref2).

           2. A tilde ~ and caret ^ are used to introduce the postfix nth
              parent and peel onion operation.

           3. A colon : is used as in srcref:dstref to mean "use srcref’s
              value and store it in dstref" in fetch and push operations.
              It may also be used to select a specific object such as with
              git cat-file: "git cat-file blob v1.3.3:refs.c".

           4. at-open-brace @{ is used as a notation to access a reflog
              entry.

          With the --branch option, the command takes a name and checks if
          it can be used as a valid branch name (e.g. when creating a new
          branch). But be cautious when using the previous checkout syntax
          that may refer to a detached HEAD state. The rule git
          check-ref-format --branch $name implements may be stricter than
          what git check-ref-format refs/heads/$name says (e.g. a dash may
          appear at the beginning of a ref component, but it is explicitly
          forbidden at the beginning of a branch name). When run with
          --branch option in a repository, the input is first expanded for
          the “previous checkout syntax” @{-n}. For example, @{-1} is a way
          to refer the last thing that was checked out using "git switch"
          or "git checkout" operation. This option should be used by
          porcelains to accept this syntax anywhere a branch name is
          expected, so they can act as if you typed the branch name. As an
          exception note that, the “previous checkout operation” might
          result in a commit object name when the N-th last thing checked
          out was not a branch.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --[no-]allow-onelevel
              Controls whether one-level refnames are accepted (i.e.,
              refnames that do not contain multiple /-separated
              components). The default is --no-allow-onelevel.

          --refspec-pattern
              Interpret <refname> as a reference name pattern for a refspec
              (as used with remote repositories). If this option is
              enabled, <refname> is allowed to contain a single * in the
              refspec (e.g., foo/bar*/baz or foo/bar*baz/ but not
              foo/bar*/baz*).

          --normalize
              Normalize refname by removing any leading slash (/)
              characters and collapsing runs of adjacent slashes between
              name components into a single slash. If the normalized
              refname is valid then print it to standard output and exit
              with a status of 0, otherwise exit with a non-zero status.
              (--print is a deprecated way to spell --normalize.)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          •   Print the name of the previous thing checked out:

                  $ git check-ref-format --branch @{-1}

          •   Determine the reference name to use for a new branch:

                  $ ref=$(git check-ref-format --normalize "refs/heads/$newbranch")||
                  { echo "we do not like '$newbranch' as a branch name." >&2 ; exit 1 ; }
