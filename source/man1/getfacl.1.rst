   GETFACL(1)                Access Control Lists                GETFACL(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          getfacl - get file access control lists


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] file ...

          getfacl [-aceEsRLPtpndvh] -


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          For each file, getfacl displays the file name, owner, the group,
          and the Access Control List (ACL). If a directory has a default
          ACL, getfacl also displays the default ACL. Non-directories
          cannot have default ACLs.

          If getfacl is used on a file system that does not support ACLs,
          getfacl displays the access permissions defined by the
          traditional file mode permission bits.

          The output format of getfacl is as follows:
                  1:  # file: somedir/
                  2:  # owner: lisa
                  3:  # group: staff
                  4:  # flags: -s-
                  5:  user::rwx
                  6:  user:joe:rwx               #effective:r-x
                  7:  group::rwx                 #effective:r-x
                  8:  group:cool:r-x
                  9:  mask::r-x
                 10:  other::r-x
                 11:  default:user::rwx
                 12:  default:user:joe:rwx       #effective:r-x
                 13:  default:group::r-x
                 14:  default:mask::r-x
                 15:  default:other::---

          Lines 1--3 indicate the file name, owner, and owning group.

          Line 4 indicates the setuid (s), setgid (s), and sticky (t) bits:
          either the letter representing the bit, or else a dash (-). This
          line is included if any of those bits is set and left out
          otherwise, so it will not be shown for most files. (See
          CONFORMANCE TO POSIX 1003.1e DRAFT STANDARD 17 below.)

          Lines 5, 7 and 10 correspond to the user, group and other fields
          of the file mode permission bits. These three are called the base
          ACL entries. Lines 6 and 8 are named user and named group
          entries. Line 9 is the effective rights mask. This entry limits
          the effective rights granted to all groups and to named users.
          (The file owner and others permissions are not affected by the
          effective rights mask; all other entries are.)  Lines 11--15
          display the default ACL associated with this directory.
          Directories may have a default ACL. Regular files never have a
          default ACL.

          The default behavior for getfacl is to display both the ACL and
          the default ACL, and to include an effective rights comment for
          lines where the rights of the entry differ from the effective
          rights.

          If output is to a terminal, the effective rights comment is
          aligned to column 40. Otherwise, a single tab character separates
          the ACL entry and the effective rights comment.

          The ACL listings of multiple files are separated by blank lines.
          The output of getfacl can also be used as input to setfacl.

      PERMISSIONS
          Process with search access to a file (i.e., processes with read
          access to the containing directory of a file) are also granted
          read access to the file's ACLs.  This is analogous to the
          permissions required for accessing the file mode.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -a, --access
              Display the file access control list.

          -d, --default
              Display the default access control list.

          -c, --omit-header
              Do not display the comment header (the first three lines of
              each file's output).

          -e, --all-effective
              Print all effective rights comments, even if identical to the
              rights defined by the ACL entry.

          -E, --no-effective
              Do not print effective rights comments.

          -s, --skip-base
              Skip files that only have the base ACL entries (owner, group,
              others).

          -R, --recursive
              List the ACLs of all files and directories recursively.

          -L, --logical
              Logical walk, follow symbolic links to directories. The
              default behavior is to follow symbolic link arguments, and
              skip symbolic links encountered in subdirectories.  Only
              effective in combination with -R.

          -P, --physical
              Physical walk, do not follow symbolic links to directories.
              This also skips symbolic link arguments.  Only effective in
              combination with -R.

          -t, --tabular
              Use an alternative tabular output format. The ACL and the
              default ACL are displayed side by side. Permissions that are
              ineffective due to the ACL mask entry are displayed
              capitalized. The entry tag names for the ACL_USER_OBJ and
              ACL_GROUP_OBJ entries are also displayed in capital letters,
              which helps in spotting those entries.

          -p, --absolute-names
              Do not strip leading slash characters (`/'). The default
              behavior is to strip leading slash characters.

          -n, --numeric
              List numeric user and group IDs

          -v, --version
              Print the version of getfacl and exit.

          -h, --help
              Print help explaining the command line options.

          --  End of command line options. All remaining parameters are
              interpreted as file names, even if they start with a dash
              character.

          -   If the file name parameter is a single dash character,
              getfacl reads a list of files from standard input.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If the environment variable POSIXLY_CORRECT is defined, the
          default behavior of getfacl changes in the following ways: Unless
          otherwise specified, only the ACL is printed. The default ACL is
          only printed if the -d option is given. If no command line
          parameter is given, getfacl behaves as if it was invoked as
          ``getfacl -''.  No flags comments indicating the setuid, setgid,
          and sticky bits are generated.
