   PMDASENDMAIL(1)          General Commands Manual         PMDASENDMAIL(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdasendmail - sendmail performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail/pmdasendmail [-d domain] [-l logfile] [-U
          username]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdasendmail is a sendmail Performance Metrics Domain Agent
          (PMDA) which exports mail traffic statistics as collected by
          sendmail(1).

          Before the sendmail PMDA can export any metrics, sendmail(1) must
          have statistics collection enabled.  This involves checking the
          name of the statistics file, as given by the OS or O StatusFile
          control lines in /etc/sendmail.cf, and then creating this file if
          it does not already exist.  Removing the file will terminate
          statistics collection by sendmail(1) and hence the sendmail PMDA.

          A brief description of the pmdasendmail command line options
          follows:

          -d   It is absolutely crucial that the performance metrics domain
               number specified here is unique and consistent.  That is,
               domain should be different for every PMDA on the one host,
               and the same domain number should be used for the same PMDA
               on all hosts.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               sendmail.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1)
               when pmdasendmail is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If
               the log file cannot be created or is not writable, output is
               written to the standard error instead.

          -U   User account under which to run the agent.  The default is
               the unprivileged "pcp" account in current versions of PCP,
               but in older versions the superuser account ("root") was
               used by default.

          There are no communication options, as the Install script ensures
          the sendmail PMDA will be connected to PMCD by a pipe.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          If you want access to the names, help text and values for the
          sendmail performance metrics, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
               # ./Install

          If you want to undo the installation, do the following as root:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/sendmail
               # ./Remove

          pmdasendmail is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd(1) when the
          agent is installed or removed.

                 statistics file


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
