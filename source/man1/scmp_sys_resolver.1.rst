NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          scmp_sys_resolver - Resolve system calls


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          scmp_sys_resolver [-h] [-a ARCH ] [-t] SYSCALL_NAME |
          SYSCALL_NUMBER


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This command resolves both system call names and numbers with
          respect to the given architecture supplied in the optional ARCH
          argument.  If the architecture is not supplied on the command
          line then the native architecture is used.  If the "-t" argument
          is specified along with a system call name, then the system call
          will be translated as necessary for the given architecture.  The
          "-t" argument has no effect if a system call number is specified.

          In some combinations of architecture and system call, a negative
          system call number will be displayed.  A negative system call
          number indicates that the system call is not defined for the
          given architecture and is treated in a special manner by
          libseccomp depending on the operation.

          -a ARCH
                 The architecture to use for resolving the system call.
                 Valid ARCH values are "x86", "x86_64", "x32", "arm",
                 "aarch64", "mips", "mipsel", "mips64", "mipsel64",
                 "mips64n32", "mipsel64n32", "parisc", "parisc64", "ppc",
                 "ppc64", "ppc64le", "s390", "s390x", "sheb" and "sh".

          -t     If necessary, translate the system call name to the proper
                 system call number, even if the system call name is
                 different, e.g. socket(2) on x86.

          -h     A simple one-line usage display.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Returns zero on success, errno values on failure.
