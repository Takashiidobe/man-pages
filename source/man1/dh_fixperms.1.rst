   DH_FIXPERMS(1)                  Debhelper                 DH_FIXPERMS(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_fixperms - fix permissions of files in package build
          directories


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_fixperms [debhelper options] [-Xitem]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          dh_fixperms is a debhelper program that is responsible for
          setting the permissions of files and directories in package build
          directories to a sane state -- a state that complies with Debian
          policy.

          dh_fixperms makes all files in usr/share/doc in the package build
          directory (excluding files in the examples/ directory) be mode
          644. It also changes the permissions of all man pages to mode
          644. It removes group and other write permission from all files.
          It removes execute permissions from any libraries, headers, Perl
          modules, or desktop files that have it set. It makes all files in
          the standard bin and sbin directories, usr/games/ and etc/init.d
          executable (since v4). Finally, it removes the setuid and setgid
          bits from all files in the package.

          When the Rules-Requires-Root field has the (effective) value of
          binary-targets, dh_fixperms will also reset the ownership of all
          paths to "root:root".


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -Xitem, --exclude item
              Exclude files that contain item anywhere in their filename
              from having their permissions changed. You may use this
              option multiple times to build up a list of things to
              exclude.
