   PMDAZFS(1)               General Commands Manual              PMDAZFS(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdazfs - ZFS filesystem performance metrics domain agent (PMDA)
          for Linux


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/linux_zfs/pmdazfs [-d domain] [-l logfile]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdazfs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          extracts performance metrics describing the state of the ZFS
          filesystem from the stats files located in /proc.

          The zfs PMDA exports metrics that measure information about
          caching (ARC, L2ARC, ZIL, VDEV), buffering, RAIDZ, dnode
          operations and pools IO.

          A brief description of the pmdazfs command line options follows:

          -d   The performance metrics domain number must be set to a
               unique value.

          -l   Location of the log file.  By default, a log file named
               zfs.log is written in the current directory of pmcd(1) when
               pmdazfs is started, i.e.  $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd.  If the log
               file cannot be created or is not writable, output is written
               to the standard error instead.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          OpenZFS is not included in PCP, and has to be installed on the
          system from the available packages or source.  Once OpenZFS is
          installed and configured, the stats files should appear in /proc
          and PMDA can be added to PMCD using the Install script:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
               # ./Install

          To remove PMDA use the Remove script:

               # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/zfs
               # ./Remove
