          repository


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak build-import-bundle [OPTION...] LOCATION FILENAME


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Imports a bundle from a file named FILENAME into the repository
          at LOCATION.

          The format of the bundle file is that generated by build-bundle.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following options are understood:

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

          -v, --verbose
              Print debug information during command processing.

          --ostree-verbose
              Print OSTree debug information during command processing.

          --ref=REF
              Override the ref specified in the bundle.

          --oci
              Import an OCI image instead of a Flatpak bundle.

          --update-appstream

          --no-update-summary
              Don't update the summary file after the new commit is added.
              This means the repository will not be useful for serving over
              http until build-update-repo has been run. This is useful is
              you want to do multiple repo operations before finally
              updating the summary.

          --gpg-sign=KEYID
              Sign the commit with this GPG key. This option can be used
              multiple times.
