   PMSIGNAL(1)              General Commands Manual             PMSIGNAL(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmsignal - send a signal to one or more processes


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_BINADM_DIR/pmsignal [-alnp] [-s signal] [PID ...|name ...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmsignal provides a cross-platform event signalling mechanism for
          use with tools from the Performance Co-Pilot toolkit.  It can be
          used to send a named signal (only HUP, USR1, TERM, and KILL are
          accepted) to one or more processes.

          The processes are specified directly using PIDs or as program
          names (with either the -a or -p options).  In the all case, the
          set of all running processes is searched for a basename(1) match
          on name.  In the program case, process identifiers are extracted
          from files in the $PCP_RUN_DIR directrory where file names are
          matched on name.pid.

          The -n option reports the list of process identifiers that would
          have been signalled, but no signals are actually sent.

          If a signal is not specified, then the TERM signal will be sent.
          The list of supported signals is reported when using the -l
          option.

          On Linux and UNIX platforms, pmsignal is a simple wrapper around
          the kill(1) command.  On Windows, the is no direct equivalent to
          this mechanism, and so an alternate mechanism has been
          implemented - this is only honoured by PCP tools, however, not
          all Windows utilities.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The available command line options are:

          -a, --all
               Send signal to all named processes.

          -l, --list
               List supported signals.

          -n, --dry-run
               List processes that would be affected.

          -p, --program
               Extract programs from PCP runtime PID files.

          -s signal, --signal=signal
               Specify the signal to send, one of: HUP, USR1, TERM, KILL.

          -?, --help
               Display usage message and exit.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP.  On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          basename(1), kill(1), killall(1), pcp.conf(5) and pcp.env(5).
