   PMDACIFS(1)              General Commands Manual             PMDACIFS(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdacifs - Common Internet Filesystem (CIFS) PMDA


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          pmdacifs is a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which
          exports metric values about mounted CIFS shares from the
          /proc/fs/cifs directory. This PMDA requires at least the CIFS
          kernel module to be loaded to return some metric values and at
          least one mounted CIFS share in order to provide data for all
          metrics.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Install the CIFS PMDA by using the Install script as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs
              # ./Install

          To uninstall, the following must be done as root:

              # cd $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs
              # ./Remove

          pmdacifs is launched by pmcd(1) and should never be executed
          directly.  The Install and Remove scripts notify pmcd when the
          agent is installed or removed.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/help
              default help text file for the CIFS metrics

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/Install
              installation script for the pmdacifs agent

          $PCP_PMDAS_DIR/cifs/Remove
              undo installation script for the pmdacifs agent

          $PCP_LOG_DIR/pmcd/cifs.log
              default log file for error messages from pmdacifs


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Environment variables with the prefix PCP_ are used to
          parameterize the file and directory names used by PCP. On each
          installation, the file /etc/pcp.conf contains the local values
          for these variables.  The $PCP_CONF variable may be used to
          specify an alternative configuration file, as described in
          pcp.conf(5).
