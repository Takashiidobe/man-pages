NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          windres - manipulate Windows resources


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          windres [options] [input-file] [output-file]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          windres reads resources from an input file and copies them into
          an output file.  Either file may be in one of three formats:

          "rc"
              A text format read by the Resource Compiler.

          "res"
              A binary format generated by the Resource Compiler.

          "coff"
              A COFF object or executable.

          The exact description of these different formats is available in
          documentation from Microsoft.

          When windres converts from the "rc" format to the "res" format,
          it is acting like the Windows Resource Compiler.  When windres
          converts from the "res" format to the "coff" format, it is acting
          like the Windows "CVTRES" program.

          When windres generates an "rc" file, the output is similar but
          not identical to the format expected for the input.  When an
          input "rc" file refers to an external filename, an output "rc"
          file will instead include the file contents.

          If the input or output format is not specified, windres will
          guess based on the file name, or, for the input file, the file
          contents.  A file with an extension of .rc will be treated as an
          "rc" file, a file with an extension of .res will be treated as a
          "res" file, and a file with an extension of .o or .exe will be
          treated as a "coff" file.

          If no output file is specified, windres will print the resources
          in "rc" format to standard output.

          The normal use is for you to write an "rc" file, use windres to
          convert it to a COFF object file, and then link the COFF file
          into your application.  This will make the resources described in
          the "rc" file available to Windows.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -i filename
          --input filename
              The name of the input file.  If this option is not used, then
              windres will use the first non-option argument as the input
              file name.  If there are no non-option arguments, then
              windres will read from standard input.  windres can not read
              a COFF file from standard input.

          -o filename
          --output filename
              The name of the output file.  If this option is not used,
              then windres will use the first non-option argument, after
              any used for the input file name, as the output file name.
              If there is no non-option argument, then windres will write
              to standard output.  windres can not write a COFF file to
              standard output.  Note, for compatibility with rc the option
              -fo is also accepted, but its use is not recommended.

          -J format
          --input-format format
              The input format to read.  format may be res, rc, or coff.
              If no input format is specified, windres will guess, as
              described above.

          -O format
          --output-format format
              The output format to generate.  format may be res, rc, or
              coff.  If no output format is specified, windres will guess,
              as described above.

          -F target
          --target target
              Specify the BFD format to use for a COFF file as input or
              output.  This is a BFD target name; you can use the --help
              option to see a list of supported targets.  Normally windres
              will use the default format, which is the first one listed by
              the --help option.

          --preprocessor program
              When windres reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C
              preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify the
              preprocessor to use, including any leading arguments.  The
              default preprocessor argument is "gcc -E -xc-header
              -DRC_INVOKED".

          --preprocessor-arg option
              When windres reads an "rc" file, it runs it through the C
              preprocessor first.  This option may be used to specify
              additional text to be passed to preprocessor on its command
              line.  This option can be used multiple times to add multiple
              options to the preprocessor command line.

          -I directory
          --include-dir directory
              Specify an include directory to use when reading an "rc"
              file.  windres will pass this to the preprocessor as an -I
              option.  windres will also search this directory when looking
              for files named in the "rc" file.  If the argument passed to
              this command matches any of the supported formats (as
              described in the -J option), it will issue a deprecation
              warning, and behave just like the -J option.  New programs
              should not use this behaviour.  If a directory happens to
              match a format, simple prefix it with ./ to disable the
              backward compatibility.

          -D target
          --define sym[=val]
              Specify a -D option to pass to the preprocessor when reading
              an "rc" file.

          -U target
          --undefine sym
              Specify a -U option to pass to the preprocessor when reading
              an "rc" file.

          -r  Ignored for compatibility with rc.

          -v  Enable verbose mode.  This tells you what the preprocessor is
              if you didn't specify one.

          -c val
          --codepage val
              Specify the default codepage to use when reading an "rc"
              file.  val should be a hexadecimal prefixed by 0x or decimal
              codepage code. The valid range is from zero up to 0xffff, but
              the validity of the codepage is host and configuration
              dependent.

          -l val
          --language val
              Specify the default language to use when reading an "rc"
              file.  val should be a hexadecimal language code.  The low
              eight bits are the language, and the high eight bits are the
              sublanguage.

          --use-temp-file
              Use a temporary file to instead of using popen to read the
              output of the preprocessor. Use this option if the popen
              implementation is buggy on the host (eg., certain non-English
              language versions of Windows 95 and Windows 98 are known to
              have buggy popen where the output will instead go the
              console).

          --no-use-temp-file
              Use popen, not a temporary file, to read the output of the
              preprocessor.  This is the default behaviour.

          -h
          --help
              Prints a usage summary.

          -V
          --version
              Prints the version number for windres.

          --yydebug
              If windres is compiled with "YYDEBUG" defined as 1, this will
              turn on parser debugging.

          @file
              Read command-line options from file.  The options read are
              inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does
              not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
              literally, and not removed.

              Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
              character may be included in an option by surrounding the
              entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
              character (including a backslash) may be included by
              prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
              file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
              options will be processed recursively.
