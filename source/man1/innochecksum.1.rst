NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          innochecksum - offline InnoDB file checksum utility


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          innochecksum [options] file_name


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          innochecksum prints checksums for InnoDB files. This tool reads
          an InnoDB tablespace file, calculates the checksum for each page,
          compares the calculated checksum to the stored checksum, and
          reports mismatches, which indicate damaged pages. It was
          originally developed to speed up verifying the integrity of
          tablespace files after power outages but can also be used after
          file copies. Because checksum mismatches will cause InnoDB to
          deliberately shut down a running server, it can be preferable to
          use this tool rather than waiting for a server in production
          usage to encounter the damaged pages.

          innochecksum cannot be used on tablespace files that the server
          already has open. For such files, you should use CHECK TABLE to
          check tables within the tablespace.

          If checksum mismatches are found, you would normally restore the
          tablespace from backup or start the server and attempt to use
          mysqldump to make a backup of the tables within the tablespace.

          Invoke innochecksum like this:

              shell> innochecksum [options] file_name

          innochecksum supports the following options. For options that
          refer to page numbers, the numbers are zero-based.

          •   -?, --help

              Displays help and exits.

          •   -c, --count

              Print a count of the number of pages in the file.

          •   -d, --debug

              Debug mode; prints checksums for each page.

          •   -e num, --end-page=#

              End at this page number.

          •   -i, --per-page-details

              Print out per-page detail information.

          •   -I, --info

              Synonym for --help.

          •   -l, --leaf

              Examine leaf index pages.

          •   -m num, --merge=#

              Leaf page count if merge given number of consecutive pages.

          •   -p num, --page-num=#

              Check only this page number.

          •   -s num, --start-page

              Start at this page number.

          •   -u, --skip-corrupt

              Skip corrupt pages.

          •   -v, --verbose

              Verbose mode; print a progress indicator every five seconds.

          •   -V, --version

              Displays version information and exits.
