   FLATPAK MAKE-CURREN(1)    flatpak make-current    FLATPAK MAKE-CURREN(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak-make-current - Make a specific version of an app current


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          flatpak make-current [OPTION...] APP BRANCH


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Makes a particular branch of an application current. Only the
          current branch of an app has its exported files (such as desktop
          files and icons) made visible to the host.

          When a new branch is installed it will automatically be made
          current, so this command is often not needed.

          Unless overridden with the --user or --installation options, this
          command changes the default system-wide installation.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following options are understood:

          -h, --help
              Show help options and exit.

          --user
              Update a per-user installation.

          --system
              Update the default system-wide installation.

          --installation=NAME
              Updates a system-wide installation specified by NAME among
              those defined in /etc/flatpak/installations.d/. Using
              --installation=default is equivalent to using --system.

          --arch=ARCH
              The architecture to make current for. See flatpak
              --supported-arches for architectures supported by the host.

          -v, --verbose
              Print debug information during command processing.

          --ostree-verbose
              Print OSTree debug information during command processing.
