   NM(1P)                  POSIX Programmer's Manual                 NM(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          nm — write the name list of an object file (DEVELOPMENT)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          nm [-APv] [-g|-u] [-t format] file...
          nm [-APv] [-efox] [-g|-u] [-t format] file...


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The nm utility shall display symbolic information appearing in
          the object file, executable file, or object-file library named by
          file.  If no symbolic information is available for a valid input
          file, the nm utility shall report that fact, but not consider it
          an error condition.

          The default base used when numeric values are written is
          unspecified.  On XSI-conformant systems, it shall be decimal if
          the -P option is not specified.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The nm utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines.

          The following options shall be supported:

          -A        Write the full pathname or library name of an object on
                    each line.

          -e        Write only external (global) and static symbol
                    information.

          -f        Produce full output. Write redundant symbols (.text,
                    .data, and .bss), normally suppressed.

          -g        Write only external (global) symbol information.

          -o        Write numeric values in octal (equivalent to -t o).

          -P        Write information in a portable output format, as
                    specified in the STDOUT section.

          -t format Write each numeric value in the specified format. The
                    format shall be dependent on the single character used
                    as the format option-argument:

                    d     decimal (default if -P is not specified).

                    o     octal.

                    x     hexadecimal (default if -P is specified).

          -u        Write only undefined symbols.

          -v        Sort output by value instead of by symbol name.

          -x        Write numeric values in hexadecimal (equivalent to
                    -t x).


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operand shall be supported:

          file      A pathname of an object file, executable file, or
                    object-file library.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          See the INPUT FILES section.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The input file shall be an object file, an object-file library
          whose format is the same as those produced by the ar utility for
          link editing, or an executable file. The nm utility may accept
          additional implementation-defined object library formats for the
          input file.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          nm:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_COLLATE
                    Determine the locale for character collation
                    information for the symbol-name and symbol-value
                    collation sequences.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments).

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          If symbolic information is present in the input files, then for
          each file or for each member of an archive, the nm utility shall
          write the following information to standard output. By default,
          the format is unspecified, but the output shall be sorted by
          symbol name according to the collation sequence in the current
          locale.

           *  Library or object name, if -A is specified

           *  Symbol name

           *  Symbol type, which shall either be one of the following
              single characters or an implementation-defined type
              represented by a single character:

              A     Global absolute symbol.

              a     Local absolute symbol.

              B     Global ``bss'' (that is, uninitialized data space)
                    symbol.

              b     Local bss symbol.

              D     Global data symbol.

              d     Local data symbol.

              T     Global text symbol.

              t     Local text symbol.

              U     Undefined symbol.

           *  Value of the symbol

           *  The size associated with the symbol, if applicable

          This information may be supplemented by additional information
          specific to the implementation.

          If the -P option is specified, the previous information shall be
          displayed using the following portable format. The three versions
          differ depending on whether -t d, -t o, or -t x was specified,
          respectively:

              "%s%s %s %d %d\n", <library/object name>, <name>, <type>,
                  <value>, <size>

              "%s%s %s %o %o\n", <library/object name>, <name>, <type>,
                  <value>, <size>

              "%s%s %s %x %x\n", <library/object name>, <name>, <type>,
                  <value>, <size>

          where <library/object name> shall be formatted as follows:

           *  If -A is not specified, <library/object name> shall be an
              empty string.

           *  If -A is specified and the corresponding file operand does
              not name a library:

                  "%s: ", <file>

           *  If -A is specified and the corresponding file operand names a
              library. In this case, <object file> shall name the object
              file in the library containing the symbol being described:

                  "%s[%s]: ", <file>, <object file>

          If -A is not specified, then if more than one file operand is
          specified or if only one file operand is specified and it names a
          library, nm shall write a line identifying the object containing
          the following symbols before the lines containing those symbols,
          in the form:

           *  If the corresponding file operand does not name a library:

                  "%s:\n", <file>

           *  If the corresponding file operand names a library; in this
              case, <object file> shall be the name of the file in the
              library containing the following symbols:

                  "%s[%s]:\n", <file>, <object file>

          If -P is specified, but -t is not, the format shall be as if -t x
          had been specified.

::

          None.

          Mechanisms for dynamic linking make this utility less meaningful
          when applied to an executable file because a dynamically linked
          executable may omit numerous library routines that would be found
          in a statically linked executable.

          Historical implementations of nm have used different bases for
          numeric output and supplied different default types of symbols
          that were reported. The -t format option, similar to that used in
          od and strings, can be used to specify the numeric base; -g and
          -u can be used to restrict the amount of output or the types of
          symbols included in the output.

          The compromise of using -t format versus using -d, -o, and other
          similar options was necessary because of differences in the
          meaning of -o between implementations. The -o option from BSD has
          been provided here as -A to avoid confusion with the -o from
          System V (which has been provided here as -t and as -o on XSI-
          conformant systems).

          The option list was significantly reduced from that provided by
          historical implementations.

          The nm description is a subset of both the System V and BSD nm
          utilities with no specified default output.

          It was recognized that mechanisms for dynamic linking make this
          utility less meaningful when applied to an executable file
          (because a dynamically linked executable file may omit numerous
          library routines that would be found in a statically linked
          executable file), but the value of nm during software development
          was judged to outweigh other limitations.

          The default output format of nm is not specified because of
          differences in historical implementations.  The -P option was
          added to allow some type of portable output format. After a
          comparison of the different formats used in SunOS, BSD, SVR3, and
          SVR4, it was decided to create one that did not match the current
          format of any of these four systems. The format devised is easy
          to parse by humans, easy to parse in shell scripts, and does not
          need to vary depending on locale (because no English descriptions
          are included).  All of the systems currently have the information
          available to use this format.

          The format given in nm STDOUT uses <space> characters between the
          fields, which may be any number of <blank> characters required to
          align the columns. The single-character types were selected to
          match historical practice, and the requirement that
          implementation additions also be single characters made parsing
          the information easier for shell scripts.
