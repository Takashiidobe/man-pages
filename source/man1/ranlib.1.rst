   RANLIB(1)                 GNU Development Tools                RANLIB(1)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ranlib - generate an index to an archive


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ranlib [--plugin name] [-DhHvVt] archive


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          ranlib generates an index to the contents of an archive and
          stores it in the archive.  The index lists each symbol defined by
          a member of an archive that is a relocatable object file.

          You may use nm -s or nm --print-armap to list this index.

          An archive with such an index speeds up linking to the library
          and allows routines in the library to call each other without
          regard to their placement in the archive.

          The GNU ranlib program is another form of GNU ar; running ranlib
          is completely equivalent to executing ar -s.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -h
          -H
          --help
              Show usage information for ranlib.

          -v
          -V
          --version
              Show the version number of ranlib.

          -D  Operate in deterministic mode.  The symbol map archive
              member's header will show zero for the UID, GID, and
              timestamp.  When this option is used, multiple runs will
              produce identical output files.

              If binutils was configured with
              --enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by
              default.  It can be disabled with the -U option, described
              below.

          -t  Update the timestamp of the symbol map of an archive.

          -U  Do not operate in deterministic mode.  This is the inverse of
              the -D option, above: the archive index will get actual UID,
              GID, timestamp, and file mode values.

              If binutils was configured without
              --enable-deterministic-archives, then this mode is on by
              default.

          @file
              Read command-line options from file.  The options read are
              inserted in place of the original @file option.  If file does
              not exist, or cannot be read, then the option will be treated
              literally, and not removed.

              Options in file are separated by whitespace.  A whitespace
              character may be included in an option by surrounding the
              entire option in either single or double quotes.  Any
              character (including a backslash) may be included by
              prefixing the character to be included with a backslash.  The
              file may itself contain additional @file options; any such
              options will be processed recursively.
