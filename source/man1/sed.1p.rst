   SED(1P)                 POSIX Programmer's Manual                SED(1P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sed — stream editor


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          sed [-n] script [file...]

          sed [-n] -e script [-e script]... [-f script_file]... [file...]

          sed [-n] [-e script]... -f script_file [-f script_file]... [file...]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sed utility is a stream editor that shall read one or more
          text files, make editing changes according to a script of editing
          commands, and write the results to standard output. The script
          shall be obtained from either the script operand string or a
          combination of the option-arguments from the -e script and -f
          script_file options.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          The sed utility shall conform to the Base Definitions volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017, Section 12.2, Utility Syntax Guidelines, except
          that the order of presentation of the -e and -f options is
          significant.

          The following options shall be supported:

          -e script Add the editing commands specified by the script
                    option-argument to the end of the script of editing
                    commands.

          -f script_file
                    Add the editing commands in the file script_file to the
                    end of the script of editing commands.

          -n        Suppress the default output (in which each line, after
                    it is examined for editing, is written to standard
                    output). Only lines explicitly selected for output are
                    written.

          If any -e or -f options are specified, the script of editing
          commands shall initially be empty. The commands specified by each
          -e or -f option shall be added to the script in the order
          specified. When each addition is made, if the previous addition
          (if any) was from a -e option, a <newline> shall be inserted
          before the new addition. The resulting script shall have the same
          properties as the script operand, described in the OPERANDS
          section.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following operands shall be supported:

          file      A pathname of a file whose contents are read and
                    edited. If multiple file operands are specified, the
                    named files shall be read in the order specified and
                    the concatenation shall be edited. If no file operands
                    are specified, the standard input shall be used.

          script    A string to be used as the script of editing commands.
                    The application shall not present a script that
                    violates the restrictions of a text file except that
                    the final character need not be a <newline>.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard input shall be used if no file operands are
          specified, and shall be used if a file operand is '-' and the
          implementation treats the '-' as meaning standard input.
          Otherwise, the standard input shall not be used.  See the INPUT
          FILES section.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The input files shall be text files. The script_files named by
          the -f option shall consist of editing commands.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following environment variables shall affect the execution of
          sed:

          LANG      Provide a default value for the internationalization
                    variables that are unset or null. (See the Base
                    Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 8.2,
                    Internationalization Variables for the precedence of
                    internationalization variables used to determine the
                    values of locale categories.)

          LC_ALL    If set to a non-empty string value, override the values
                    of all the other internationalization variables.

          LC_COLLATE
                    Determine the locale for the behavior of ranges,
                    equivalence classes, and multi-character collating
                    elements within regular expressions.

          LC_CTYPE  Determine the locale for the interpretation of
                    sequences of bytes of text data as characters (for
                    example, single-byte as opposed to multi-byte
                    characters in arguments and input files), and the
                    behavior of character classes within regular
                    expressions.

          LC_MESSAGES
                    Determine the locale that should be used to affect the
                    format and contents of diagnostic messages written to
                    standard error.

          NLSPATH   Determine the location of message catalogs for the
                    processing of LC_MESSAGES.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Default.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The input files shall be written to standard output, with the
          editing commands specified in the script applied. If the -n
          option is specified, only those input lines selected by the
          script shall be written to standard output.


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          The standard error shall be used only for diagnostic and warning
          messages.


-----------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The output files shall be text files whose formats are dependent
          on the editing commands given.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The script shall consist of editing commands of the following
          form:

              [address[,address]]function

          where function represents a single-character command verb from
          the list in Editing Commands in sed, followed by any applicable
          arguments.

          The command can be preceded by <blank> characters and/or
          <semicolon> characters. The function can be preceded by <blank>
          characters. These optional characters shall have no effect.

          In default operation, sed cyclically shall append a line of
          input, less its terminating <newline> character, into the pattern
          space. Reading from input shall be skipped if a <newline> was in
          the pattern space prior to a D command ending the previous cycle.
          The sed utility shall then apply in sequence all commands whose
          addresses select that pattern space, until a command starts the
          next cycle or quits. If no commands explicitly started a new
          cycle, then at the end of the script the pattern space shall be
          copied to standard output (except when -n is specified) and the
          pattern space shall be deleted. Whenever the pattern space is
          written to standard output or a named file, sed shall immediately
          follow it with a <newline>.

          Some of the editing commands use a hold space to save all or part
          of the pattern space for subsequent retrieval. The pattern and
          hold spaces shall each be able to hold at least 8192 bytes.

      Addresses in sed
          An address is either a decimal number that counts input lines
          cumulatively across files, a '$' character that addresses the
          last line of input, or a context address (which consists of a
          BRE, as described in Regular Expressions in sed, preceded and
          followed by a delimiter, usually a <slash>).

          An editing command with no addresses shall select every pattern
          space.

          An editing command with one address shall select each pattern
          space that matches the address.

          An editing command with two addresses shall select the inclusive
          range from the first pattern space that matches the first address
          through the next pattern space that matches the second. (If the
          second address is a number less than or equal to the line number
          first selected, only one line shall be selected.) Starting at the
          first line following the selected range, sed shall look again for
          the first address. Thereafter, the process shall be repeated.
          Omitting either or both of the address components in the
          following form produces undefined results:

              [address[,address]]

      Regular Expressions in sed
          The sed utility shall support the BREs described in the Base
          Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017, Section 9.3, Basic Regular
          Expressions, with the following additions:

           *  In a context address, the construction "\cBREc", where c is
              any character other than <backslash> or <newline>, shall be
              identical to "/BRE/".  If the character designated by c
              appears following a <backslash>, then it shall be considered
              to be that literal character, which shall not terminate the
              BRE. For example, in the context address "\xabc\xdefx", the
              second x stands for itself, so that the BRE is "abcxdef".

           *  The escape sequence '\n' shall match a <newline> embedded in
              the pattern space. A literal <newline> shall not be used in
              the BRE of a context address or in the substitute function.

           *  If an RE is empty (that is, no pattern is specified) sed
              shall behave as if the last RE used in the last command
              applied (either as an address or as part of a substitute
              command) was specified.

      Editing Commands in sed
          In the following list of editing commands, the maximum number of
          permissible addresses for each function is indicated by [0addr],
          [1addr], or [2addr], representing zero, one, or two addresses.

          The argument text shall consist of one or more lines. Each
          embedded <newline> in the text shall be preceded by a
          <backslash>.  Other <backslash> characters in text shall be
          removed, and the following character shall be treated literally.

          The r and w command verbs, and the w flag to the s command, take
          an rfile (or wfile) parameter, separated from the command verb
          letter or flag by one or more <blank> characters; implementations
          may allow zero separation as an extension.

          The argument rfile or the argument wfile shall terminate the
          editing command. Each wfile shall be created before processing
          begins. Implementations shall support at least ten wfile
          arguments in the script; the actual number (greater than or equal
          to 10) that is supported by the implementation is unspecified.
          The use of the wfile parameter shall cause that file to be
          initially created, if it does not exist, or shall replace the
          contents of an existing file.

          The b, r, s, t, w, y, and : command verbs shall accept additional
          arguments. The following synopses indicate which arguments shall
          be separated from the command verbs by a single <space>.

          The a and r commands schedule text for later output. The text
          specified for the a command, and the contents of the file
          specified for the r command, shall be written to standard output
          just before the next attempt to fetch a line of input when
          executing the N or n commands, or when reaching the end of the
          script. If written when reaching the end of the script, and the
          -n option was not specified, the text shall be written after
          copying the pattern space to standard output. The contents of the
          file specified for the r command shall be as of the time the
          output is written, not the time the r command is applied. The
          text shall be output in the order in which the a and r commands
          were applied to the input.

          Editing commands other than {...}, a, b, c, i, r, t, w, :, and #
          can be followed by a <semicolon>, optional <blank> characters,
          and another editing command. However, when an s editing command
          is used with the w flag, following it with another command in
          this manner produces undefined results.

          A function can be preceded by a '!'  character, in which case the
          function shall be applied if the addresses do not select the
          pattern space. Zero or more <blank> characters shall be accepted
          before the '!'  character. It is unspecified whether <blank>
          characters can follow the '!'  character, and conforming
          applications shall not follow the '!'  character with <blank>
          characters.

          If a label argument (to a b, t, or : command) contains characters
          outside of the portable filename character set, or if a label is
          longer than 8 bytes, the behavior is unspecified. The
          implementation shall support label arguments recognized as unique
          up to at least 8 bytes; the actual length (greater than or equal
          to 8) supported by the implementation is unspecified. It is
          unspecified whether exceeding the maximum supported label length
          causes an error or a silent truncation.

          [2addr] {editing command

          editing command

          ...

          }         Execute a list of sed editing commands only when the
                    pattern space is selected. The list of sed editing
                    commands shall be surrounded by braces. The braces can
                    be preceded or followed by <blank> characters. The
                    <right-brace> shall be preceded by a <newline> or
                    <semicolon> (before any optional <blank> characters
                    preceding the <right-brace>).

                    Each command in the list of commands shall be
                    terminated by a <newline> character, or by a
                    <semicolon> character if permitted when the command is
                    used outside the braces.  The editing commands can be
                    preceded by <blank> characters, but shall not be
                    followed by <blank> characters.

          [1addr]a\

          text      Write text to standard output as described previously.

          [2addr]b [label]
                    Branch to the : command verb bearing the label
                    argument.  If label is not specified, branch to the end
                    of the script.

          [2addr]c\

          text      Delete the pattern space. With a 0 or 1 address or at
                    the end of a 2-address range, place text on the output
                    and start the next cycle.

          [2addr]d  Delete the pattern space and start the next cycle.

          [2addr]D  If the pattern space contains no <newline>, delete the
                    pattern space and start a normal new cycle as if the d
                    command was issued. Otherwise, delete the initial
                    segment of the pattern space through the first
                    <newline>, and start the next cycle with the resultant
                    pattern space and without reading any new input.

          [2addr]g  Replace the contents of the pattern space by the
                    contents of the hold space.

          [2addr]G  Append to the pattern space a <newline> followed by the
                    contents of the hold space.

          [2addr]h  Replace the contents of the hold space with the
                    contents of the pattern space.

          [2addr]H  Append to the hold space a <newline> followed by the
                    contents of the pattern space.

          [1addr]i\

          text      Write text to standard output.

          [2addr]l  (The letter ell.) Write the pattern space to standard
                    output in a visually unambiguous form. The characters
                    listed in the Base Definitions volume of POSIX.1‐2017,
                    Table 5-1, Escape Sequences and Associated Actions
                    ('\\', '\a', '\b', '\f', '\r', '\t', '\v') shall be
                    written as the corresponding escape sequence; the '\n'
                    in that table is not applicable. Non-printable
                    characters not in that table shall be written as one
                    three-digit octal number (with a preceding <backslash>)
                    for each byte in the character (most significant byte
                    first).

                    Long lines shall be folded, with the point of folding
                    indicated by writing a <backslash> followed by a
                    <newline>; the length at which folding occurs is
                    unspecified, but should be appropriate for the output
                    device. The end of each line shall be marked with a
                    '$'.

          [2addr]n  Write the pattern space to standard output if the
                    default output has not been suppressed, and replace the
                    pattern space with the next line of input, less its
                    terminating <newline>.

                    If no next line of input is available, the n command
                    verb shall branch to the end of the script and quit
                    without starting a new cycle.

          [2addr]N  Append the next line of input, less its terminating
                    <newline>, to the pattern space, using an embedded
                    <newline> to separate the appended material from the
                    original material. Note that the current line number
                    changes.

                    If no next line of input is available, the N command
                    verb shall branch to the end of the script and quit
                    without starting a new cycle or copying the pattern
                    space to standard output.

          [2addr]p  Write the pattern space to standard output.

          [2addr]P  Write the pattern space, up to the first <newline>, to
                    standard output.

          [1addr]q  Branch to the end of the script and quit without
                    starting a new cycle.

          [1addr]r rfile
                    Copy the contents of rfile to standard output as
                    described previously. If rfile does not exist or cannot
                    be read, it shall be treated as if it were an empty
                    file, causing no error condition.

          [2addr]s/BRE/replacement/flags
                    Substitute the replacement string for instances of the
                    BRE in the pattern space. Any character other than
                    <backslash> or <newline> can be used instead of a
                    <slash> to delimit the BRE and the replacement. Within
                    the BRE and the replacement, the BRE delimiter itself
                    can be used as a literal character if it is preceded by
                    a <backslash>.

                    The replacement string shall be scanned from beginning
                    to end. An <ampersand> ('&') appearing in the
                    replacement shall be replaced by the string matching
                    the BRE. The special meaning of '&' in this context can
                    be suppressed by preceding it by a <backslash>.  The
                    characters "\n", where n is a digit, shall be replaced
                    by the text matched by the corresponding back-reference
                    expression. If the corresponding back-reference
                    expression does not match, then the characters "\n"
                    shall be replaced by the empty string. The special
                    meaning of "\n" where n is a digit in this context, can
                    be suppressed by preceding it by a <backslash>.  For
                    each other <backslash> encountered, the following
                    character shall lose its special meaning (if any).

                    A line can be split by substituting a <newline> into
                    it. The application shall escape the <newline> in the
                    replacement by preceding it by a <backslash>.

                    The meaning of an unescaped <backslash> immediately
                    followed by any character other than '&', <backslash>,
                    a digit, <newline>, or the delimiter character used for
                    this command, is unspecified.

                    A substitution shall be considered to have been
                    performed even if the replacement string is identical
                    to the string that it replaces. Any <backslash> used to
                    alter the default meaning of a subsequent character
                    shall be discarded from the BRE or the replacement
                    before evaluating the BRE or using the replacement.

                    The value of flags shall be zero or more of:

                    n         Substitute for the nth occurrence only of the
                              BRE found within the pattern space.

                    g         Globally substitute for all non-overlapping
                              instances of the BRE rather than just the
                              first one. If both g and n are specified, the
                              results are unspecified.

                    p         Write the pattern space to standard output if
                              a replacement was made.

                    w wfile   Write. Append the pattern space to wfile if a
                              replacement was made. A conforming
                              application shall precede the wfile argument
                              with one or more <blank> characters. If the w
                              flag is not the last flag value given in a
                              concatenation of multiple flag values, the
                              results are undefined.

          [2addr]t [label]
                    Test. Branch to the : command verb bearing the label if
                    any substitutions have been made since the most recent
                    reading of an input line or execution of a t.  If label
                    is not specified, branch to the end of the script.

          [2addr]w wfile
                    Append (write) the pattern space to wfile.

          [2addr]x  Exchange the contents of the pattern and hold spaces.

          [2addr]y/string1/string2/
                    Replace all occurrences of characters in string1 with
                    the corresponding characters in string2.  If a
                    <backslash> followed by an 'n' appear in string1 or
                    string2, the two characters shall be handled as a
                    single <newline>.  If the number of characters in
                    string1 and string2 are not equal, or if any of the
                    characters in string1 appear more than once, the
                    results are undefined. Any character other than
                    <backslash> or <newline> can be used instead of <slash>
                    to delimit the strings. If the delimiter is not 'n',
                    within string1 and string2, the delimiter itself can be
                    used as a literal character if it is preceded by a
                    <backslash>.  If a <backslash> character is immediately
                    followed by a <backslash> character in string1 or
                    string2, the two <backslash> characters shall be
                    counted as a single literal <backslash> character. The
                    meaning of a <backslash> followed by any character that
                    is not 'n', a <backslash>, or the delimiter character
                    is undefined.

          [0addr]:label
                    Do nothing. This command bears a label to which the b
                    and t commands branch.

          [1addr]=  Write the following to standard output:

                        "%d\n", <current line number>

          [0addr]   Ignore this empty command.

          [0addr]#  Ignore the '#' and the remainder of the line (treat
                    them as a comment), with the single exception that if
                    the first two characters in the script are "#n", the
                    default output shall be suppressed; this shall be the
                    equivalent of specifying -n on the command line.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following exit values shall be returned:

           0    Successful completion.

          >0    An error occurred.

          Default.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Regular expressions match entire strings, not just individual
          lines, but a <newline> is matched by '\n' in a sed RE; a
          <newline> is not allowed by the general definition of regular
          expression in POSIX.1‐2008. Also note that '\n' cannot be used to
          match a <newline> at the end of an arbitrary input line;
          <newline> characters appear in the pattern space as a result of
          the N editing command.

          When using sed to process pathnames, it is recommended that
          LC_ALL, or at least LC_CTYPE and LC_COLLATE, are set to POSIX or
          C in the environment, since pathnames can contain byte sequences
          that do not form valid characters in some locales, in which case
          the utility's behavior would be undefined. In the POSIX locale
          each byte is a valid single-byte character, and therefore this
          problem is avoided.

          This sed script simulates the BSD cat -s command, squeezing
          excess empty lines from standard input.

              sed -n '
              # Write non-empty lines.
              /./ {
                  p
                  d
                  }
              # Write a single empty line, then look for more empty lines.
              /^$/    p
              # Get next line, discard the held <newline> (empty line),
              # and look for more empty lines.
              :Empty
              /^$/    {
                  N
                  s/.//
                  b Empty
                  }
              # Write the non-empty line before going back to search
              # for the first in a set of empty lines.
                  p
              '

          The following sed command is a much simpler method of squeezing
          empty lines, although it is not quite the same as cat -s since it
          removes any initial empty lines:

              sed -n '/./,/^$/p'

          This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires implementations to support
          at least ten distinct wfiles, matching historical practice on
          many implementations. Implementations are encouraged to support
          more, but conforming applications should not exceed this limit.

          The exit status codes specified here are different from those in
          System V. System V returns 2 for garbled sed commands, but
          returns zero with its usage message or if the input file could
          not be opened. The standard developers considered this to be a
          bug.

          The manner in which the l command writes non-printable characters
          was changed to avoid the historical backspace-overstrike method,
          and other requirements to achieve unambiguous output were added.
          See the RATIONALE for ed(1p) for details of the format chosen,
          which is the same as that chosen for sed.

          This volume of POSIX.1‐2017 requires implementations to provide
          pattern and hold spaces of at least 8192 bytes, larger than the
          4000 bytes spaces used by some historical implementations, but
          less than the 20480 bytes limit used in an early proposal.
          Implementations are encouraged to allocate dynamically larger
          pattern and hold spaces as needed.

          The requirements for acceptance of <blank> and <space> characters
          in command lines has been made more explicit than in early
          proposals to describe clearly the historical practice and to
          remove confusion about the phrase ``protect initial blanks [sic]
          and tabs from the stripping that is done on every script line''
          that appears in much of the historical documentation of the sed
          utility description of text. (Not all implementations are known
          to have stripped <blank> characters from text lines, although
          they all have allowed leading <blank> characters preceding the
          address on a command line.)

          The treatment of '#' comments differs from the SVID which only
          allows a comment as the first line of the script, but matches
          BSD-derived implementations. The comment character is treated as
          a command, and it has the same properties in terms of being
          accepted with leading <blank> characters; the BSD implementation
          has historically supported this.

          Early proposals required that a script_file have at least one
          non-comment line. Some historical implementations have behaved in
          unexpected ways if this were not the case. The standard
          developers considered that this was incorrect behavior and that
          application developers should not have to avoid this feature. A
          correct implementation of this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 shall
          permit script_files that consist only of comment lines.

          Early proposals indicated that if -e and -f options were
          intermixed, all -e options were processed before any -f options.
          This has been changed to process them in the order presented
          because it matches historical practice and is more intuitive.

          The treatment of the p flag to the s command differs between
          System V and BSD-based systems when the default output is
          suppressed. In the two examples:

              echo a | sed    's/a/A/p'
              echo a | sed -n 's/a/A/p'

          this volume of POSIX.1‐2017, BSD, System V documentation, and the
          SVID indicate that the first example should write two lines with
          A, whereas the second should write one. Some System V systems
          write the A only once in both examples because the p flag is
          ignored if the -n option is not specified.

          This is a case of a diametrical difference between systems that
          could not be reconciled through the compromise of declaring the
          behavior to be unspecified. The SVID/BSD/System V documentation
          behavior was adopted for this volume of POSIX.1‐2017 because:

           *  No known documentation for any historic system describes the
              interaction between the p flag and the -n option.

           *  The selected behavior is more correct as there is no
              technical justification for any interaction between the p
              flag and the -n option. A relationship between -n and the p
              flag might imply that they are only used together, but this
              ignores valid scripts that interrupt the cyclical nature of
              the processing through the use of the D, d, q, or branching
              commands. Such scripts rely on the p suffix to write the
              pattern space because they do not make use of the default
              output at the ``bottom'' of the script.

           *  Because the -n option makes the p flag unnecessary, any
              interaction would only be useful if sed scripts were written
              to run both with and without the -n option. This is believed
              to be unlikely. It is even more unlikely that programmers
              have coded the p flag expecting it to be unnecessary. Because
              the interaction was not documented, the likelihood of a
              programmer discovering the interaction and depending on it is
              further decreased.

           *  Finally, scripts that break under the specified behavior
              produce too much output instead of too little, which is
              easier to diagnose and correct.

          The form of the substitute command that uses the n suffix was
          limited to the first 512 matches in an early proposal. This limit
          has been removed because there is no reason an editor processing
          lines of {LINE_MAX} length should have this restriction. The
          command s/a/A/2047 should be able to substitute the 2047th
          occurrence of a on a line.

          The b, t, and : commands are documented to ignore leading white
          space, but no mention is made of trailing white space. Historical
          implementations of sed assigned different locations to the labels
          'x' and "x ".  This is not useful, and leads to subtle
          programming errors, but it is historical practice, and changing
          it could theoretically break working scripts. Implementors are
          encouraged to provide warning messages about labels that are
          never referenced by a b or t command, jumps to labels that do not
          exist, and label arguments that are subject to truncation.

          Earlier versions of this standard allowed for implementations
          with bytes other than eight bits, but this has been modified in
          this version.
