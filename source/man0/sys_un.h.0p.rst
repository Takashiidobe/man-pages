   sys_un.h(0P)            POSIX Programmer's Manual           sys_un.h(0P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sys/un.h — definitions for UNIX domain sockets


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <sys/un.h>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The <sys/un.h> header shall define the sockaddr_un structure,
          which shall include at least the following members:

              sa_family_t  sun_family  Address family.
              char         sun_path[]  Socket pathname.

          The sockaddr_un structure is used to store addresses for UNIX
          domain sockets.  Pointers to this type shall be cast by
          applications to struct sockaddr * for use with socket functions.

          The <sys/un.h> header shall define the sa_family_t type as
          described in <sys/socket.h>.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The size of sun_path has intentionally been left undefined. This
          is because different implementations use different sizes. For
          example, 4.3 BSD uses a size of 108, and 4.4 BSD uses a size of
          104. Since most implementations originate from BSD versions, the
          size is typically in the range 92 to 108.

          Applications should not assume a particular length for sun_path
          or assume that it can hold {_POSIX_PATH_MAX} bytes (256).

          Although applications are required to initialize all members
          (including any non-standard ones) of a sockaddr_in6 structure
          (see netinet_in.h(0p)), the same is not required for the
          sockaddr_un structure, since historically many applications only
          initialized the standard members. Despite this, applications are
          encouraged to initialize sockaddr_un structures in a manner
          similar to the required initialization of sockaddr_in6
          structures.
