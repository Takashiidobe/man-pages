   sys_stat.h(0P)          POSIX Programmer's Manual         sys_stat.h(0P)


-----------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page is part of the POSIX Programmer's Manual.  The
          Linux implementation of this interface may differ (consult the
          corresponding Linux manual page for details of Linux behavior),
          or the interface may not be implemented on Linux.

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          sys/stat.h — data returned by the stat() function


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          #include <sys/stat.h>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the structure of the data
          returned by the fstat(), lstat(), and stat() functions.

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the stat structure, which
          shall include at least the following members:

              dev_t st_dev            Device ID of device containing file.
              ino_t st_ino            File serial number.
              mode_t st_mode          Mode of file (see below).
              nlink_t st_nlink        Number of hard links to the file.
              uid_t st_uid            User ID of file.
              gid_t st_gid            Group ID of file.
              dev_t st_rdev           Device ID (if file is character or block special).
              off_t st_size           For regular files, the file size in bytes.
                                      For symbolic links, the length in bytes of the
                                      pathname contained in the symbolic link.
                                      For a shared memory object, the length in bytes.
                                      For a typed memory object, the length in bytes.
                                      For other file types, the use of this field is
                                      unspecified.
              struct timespec st_atim Last data access timestamp.
              struct timespec st_mtim Last data modification timestamp.
              struct timespec st_ctim Last file status change timestamp.
              blksize_t st_blksize    A file system-specific preferred I/O block size
                                      for this object. In some file system types, this
                                      may vary from file to file.
              blkcnt_t st_blocks      Number of blocks allocated for this object.

          The st_ino and st_dev fields taken together uniquely identify the
          file within the system.

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the blkcnt_t, blksize_t,
          dev_t, ino_t, mode_t, nlink_t, uid_t, gid_t, off_t, and time_t
          types as described in <sys/types.h>.

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the timespec structure as
          described in <time.h>.  Times shall be given in seconds since the
          Epoch.

          Which structure members have meaningful values depends on the
          type of file. For further information, see the descriptions of
          fstat(), lstat(), and stat() in the System Interfaces volume of
          POSIX.1‐2017.

          For compatibility with earlier versions of this standard, the
          st_atime macro shall be defined with the value st_atim.tv_sec.
          Similarly, st_ctime and st_mtime shall be defined as macros with
          the values st_ctim.tv_sec and st_mtim.tv_sec, respectively.

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
          constants for the file types encoded in type mode_t.  The values
          shall be suitable for use in #if preprocessing directives:

          S_IFMT      Type of file.

                      S_IFBLK     Block special.

                      S_IFCHR     Character special.

                      S_IFIFO     FIFO special.

                      S_IFREG     Regular.

                      S_IFDIR     Directory.

                      S_IFLNK     Symbolic link.

                      S_IFSOCK    Socket.

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
          constants for the file mode bits encoded in type mode_t, with the
          indicated numeric values. These macros shall expand to an
          expression which has a type that allows them to be used, either
          singly or OR'ed together, as the third argument to open() without
          the need for a mode_t cast. The values shall be suitable for use
          in #if preprocessing directives.

          macros shall be provided to test whether a file is of the
          specified type. The value of the buf argument supplied to the
          macros is a pointer to a stat structure. The macro shall evaluate
          to a non-zero value if the specified object is implemented as a

          The implementation may implement typed memory objects as distinct
          file types, and the following macro shall test whether a file is

          The <sys/stat.h> header shall define the following symbolic
          constants as distinct integer values outside of the range
          [0,999999999], for use with the futimens() and utimensat()
          functions: UTIME_NOW UTIME_OMIT

          The following shall be declared as functions and may also be
          defined as macros. Function prototypes shall be provided.

              mode_t umask(mode_t);
              int    utimensat(int, const char *, const struct timespec [2], int);

          Inclusion of the <sys/stat.h> header may make visible all symbols
          from the <time.h> header.

          The following sections are informative.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Use of the macros is recommended for determining the type of a
          file.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          A conforming C-language application must include <sys/stat.h> for
          functions that have arguments or return values of type mode_t, so
          that symbolic values for that type can be used. An alternative
          would be to require that these constants are also defined by
          including <sys/types.h>.

          The S_ISUID and S_ISGID bits may be cleared on any write, not
          just on open(), as some historical implementations do.

          System calls that update the time entry fields in the stat
          structure must be documented by the implementors. POSIX-
          conforming systems should not update the time entry fields for
          functions listed in the System Interfaces volume of POSIX.1‐2017
          unless the standard requires that they do, except in the case of
          documented extensions to the standard.

          Upon assignment, file timestamps are immediately converted to the
          resolution of the file system by truncation (i.e., the recorded
          time can be older than the actual time). For example, if the file
          system resolution is 1 microsecond, then a conforming stat() must
          always return an st_mtim.tv_nsec that is a multiple of 1000. Some
          older implementations returned higher-resolution timestamps while
          the inode information was cached, and then spontaneously
          truncated the tv_nsec fields when they were stored to and
          retrieved from disk, but this behavior does not conform.

          Note that st_dev must be unique within a Local Area Network (LAN)
          in a ``system'' made up of multiple computers' file systems
          connected by a LAN.

          Networked implementations of a POSIX-conforming system must
          guarantee that all files visible within the file tree (including
          parts of the tree that may be remotely mounted from other
          machines on the network) on each individual processor are
          uniquely identified by the combination of the st_ino and st_dev
          fields.

          The unit for the st_blocks member of the stat structure is not
          defined within POSIX.1‐2008. In some implementations it is 512
          bytes. It may differ on a file system basis. There is no
          correlation between values of the st_blocks and st_blksize, and
          the f_bsize (from <sys/statvfs.h>) structure members.

          Traditionally, some implementations defined the multiplier for
          st_blocks in <sys/param.h> as the symbol DEV_BSIZE.

          Some earlier versions of this standard did not specify values for
          the file mode bit macros. The expectation was that some
          implementors might choose to use a different encoding for these
          bits than the traditional one, and that new applications would
          use symbolic file modes instead of numeric. This version of the
          standard specifies the traditional encoding, in recognition that
          nearly 20 years after the first publication of this standard
          numeric file modes are still in widespread use by application
          developers, and that all conforming implementations still use the
          traditional encoding.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          No new S_IFMT symbolic names for the file type values of mode_t
          will be defined by POSIX.1‐2008; if new file types are required,
          they will only be testable through S_ISxx() or S_TYPEISxxx()
          macros instead.
