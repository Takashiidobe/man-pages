NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          iptunnel - creates, changes, deletes, and displays configured
          tunnels


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          iptunnel [<operation>] [<args>]


-------------------------------------------------

::

          This program is obsolete. Please use ip tunnel instead, and see
          ip-tunnel(8) for more information.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The iptunnel command creates configured tunnels for sending and
          receiving IPv6 or IPv4 packets that are encapsulated as the
          payload of an IPv4 datagram.

          The iptunnel command can perform one of the following operations:

          create - create a tunnel interface, which you must subsequently
          configure.

          change - change an existing tunnel interface.

          delete - delete a tunnel interface. You must disable the tunnel
          before you can delete it.

          show - show the tunnel attributes (name, tunnel end points, next
          hop for tunneled packets).
