NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          augenrules - a script that merges component audit rule files


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          augenrules [--check] [--load]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          augenrules is a script that merges all component audit rules
          files, found in the audit rules directory, /etc/audit/rules.d,
          placing the merged file in /etc/audit/audit.rules. Component
          audit rule files, must end in .rules in order to be processed.
          All other files in /etc/audit/rules.d are ignored.

          The files are concatenated in order, based on their natural sort
          (see -v option of ls(1)) and stripped of empty and comment (#)
          lines.

          The last processed -D directive without an option, if present, is
          always emitted as the first line in the resultant file. Those
          with an option are replicated in place.  The last processed -b
          directive, if present, is always emitted as the second line in
          the resultant file.  The last processed -f directive, if present,
          is always emitted as the third line in the resultant file.  The
          last processed -e directive, if present, is always emitted as the
          last line in the resultant file.

          The generated file is only copied to /etc/audit/audit.rules, if
          it differs.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          --check
                 test if rules have changed and need updating without
                 overwriting audit.rules.

          --load load old or newly built rules into the kernel.
