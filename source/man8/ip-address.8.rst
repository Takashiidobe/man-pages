::

          The address is a protocol (IPv4 or IPv6) address attached to a
          network device. Each device must have at least one address to use
          the corresponding protocol. It is possible to have several
          different addresses attached to one device. These addresses are
          not discriminated, so that the term alias is not quite
          appropriate for them and we do not use it in this document.

          The ip address command displays addresses and their properties,
          adds new addresses and deletes old ones.

      ip address add - add new protocol address.
          dev IFNAME
                 the name of the device to add the address to.

          local ADDRESS (default)
                 the address of the interface. The format of the address
                 depends on the protocol. It is a dotted quad for IP and a
                 sequence of hexadecimal halfwords separated by colons for
                 IPv6. The ADDRESS may be followed by a slash and a decimal
                 number which encodes the network prefix length.

          peer ADDRESS
                 the address of the remote endpoint for pointopoint
                 interfaces.  Again, the ADDRESS may be followed by a slash
                 and a decimal number, encoding the network prefix length.
                 If a peer address is specified, the local address cannot
                 have a prefix length. The network prefix is associated
                 with the peer rather than with the local address.

          broadcast ADDRESS
                 the broadcast address on the interface.

                 It is possible to use the special symbols '+' and '-'
                 instead of the broadcast address. In this case, the
                 broadcast address is derived by setting/resetting the host
                 bits of the interface prefix.

          label LABEL
                 Each address may be tagged with a label string.  In order
                 to preserve compatibility with Linux-2.0 net aliases, this
                 string must coincide with the name of the device or must
                 be prefixed with the device name followed by colon.  The
                 maximum allowed total length of label is 15 characters.

          scope SCOPE_VALUE
                 the scope of the area where this address is valid.  The
                 available scopes are listed in file
                 /etc/iproute2/rt_scopes.  Predefined scope values are:

                         global - the address is globally valid.

                         site - (IPv6 only, deprecated) the address is site
                         local, i.e. it is valid inside this site.

                         link - the address is link local, i.e. it is valid
                         only on this device.

                         host - the address is valid only inside this host.

          metric NUMBER
                 priority of prefix route associated with address.

          valid_lft LFT
                 the valid lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4 of
                 RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is removed by the
                 kernel.  Defaults to forever.

          preferred_lft LFT
                 the preferred lifetime of this address; see section 5.5.4
                 of RFC 4862. When it expires, the address is no longer
                 used for new outgoing connections. Defaults to forever.

          home   (IPv6 only) designates this address the "home address" as
                 defined in RFC 6275.

          mngtmpaddr
                 (IPv6 only) make the kernel manage temporary addresses
                 created from this one as template on behalf of Privacy
                 Extensions (RFC3041). For this to become active, the
                 use_tempaddr sysctl setting has to be set to a value
                 greater than zero.  The given address needs to have a
                 prefix length of 64. This flag allows to use privacy
                 extensions in a manually configured network, just like if
                 stateless auto-configuration was active.

          nodad  (IPv6 only) do not perform Duplicate Address Detection
                 (RFC 4862) when adding this address.

          optimistic
                 (IPv6 only) When performing Duplicate Address Detection,
                 use the RFC 4429 optimistic variant.

          noprefixroute
                 Do not automatically create a route for the network prefix
                 of the added address, and don't search for one to delete
                 when removing the address. Changing an address to add this
                 flag will remove the automatically added prefix route,
                 changing it to remove this flag will create the prefix
                 route automatically.

          autojoin
                 Joining multicast groups on Ethernet level via ip maddr
                 command does not work if connected to an Ethernet switch
                 that does IGMP snooping since the switch would not
                 replicate multicast packets on ports that did not have
                 IGMP reports for the multicast addresses.

                 Linux VXLAN interfaces created via ip link add vxlan have
                 the group option that enables them to do the required
                 join.

                 Using the autojoin flag when adding a multicast address
                 enables similar functionality for Openvswitch VXLAN
                 interfaces as well as other tunneling mechanisms that need
                 to receive multicast traffic.

      ip address delete - delete protocol address
          Arguments: coincide with the arguments of ip addr add.  The
          device name is a required argument. The rest are optional.  If no
          arguments are given, the first address is deleted.

      ip address show - look at protocol addresses
          dev IFNAME (default)
                 name of device.

          scope SCOPE_VAL
                 only list addresses with this scope.

          to PREFIX
                 only list addresses matching this prefix.

          label PATTERN
                 only list addresses with labels matching the PATTERN.
                 PATTERN is a usual shell style pattern.

          master DEVICE
                 only list interfaces enslaved to this master device.

          vrf NAME
                 only list interfaces enslaved to this vrf.

          type TYPE
                 only list interfaces of the given type.

                 Note that the type name is not checked against the list of
                 supported types - instead it is sent as-is to the kernel.
                 Later it is used to filter the returned interface list by
                 comparing it with the relevant attribute in case the
                 kernel didn't filter already. Therefore any string is
                 accepted, but may lead to empty output.

          up     only list running interfaces.

          dynamic and permanent
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses installed due to stateless
                 address configuration or only list permanent (not dynamic)
                 addresses. These two flags are inverses of each other, so
                 -dynamic is equal to permanent and -permanent is equal to
                 dynamic.

          tentative
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not yet passed
                 duplicate address detection.

          -tentative
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses which are not in the
                 process of duplicate address detection currently.

          deprecated
                 (IPv6 only) only list deprecated addresses.

          -deprecated
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses not being deprecated.

          dadfailed
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have failed
                 duplicate address detection.

          -dadfailed
                 (IPv6 only) only list addresses which have not failed
                 duplicate address detection.

          temporary or secondary
                 List temporary IPv6 or secondary IPv4 addresses only. The
                 Linux kernel shares a single bit for those, so they are
                 actually aliases for each other although the meaning
                 differs depending on address family.

          -temporary or -secondary
                 These flags are aliases for primary.

          primary
                 List only primary addresses, in IPv6 exclude temporary
                 ones. This flag is the inverse of temporary and secondary.

          -primary
                 This is an alias for temporary or secondary.

      ip address flush - flush protocol addresses
          This command flushes the protocol addresses selected by some
          criteria.

          This command has the same arguments as show except that type and
          master selectors are not supported.  Another difference is that
          it does not run when no arguments are given.

          Warning: This command and other flush commands are unforgiving.
          They will cruelly purge all the addresses.

          With the -statistics option, the command becomes verbose. It
          prints out the number of deleted addresses and the number of
          rounds made to flush the address list.  If this option is given
          twice, ip address flush also dumps all the deleted addresses in
          the format described in the previous subsection.

::

          ip address show
              Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to all network
              interfaces. The 'show' subcommand can be omitted.

          ip address show up
              Same as above except that only addresses assigned to active
              network interfaces are shown.

          ip address show dev eth0
              Shows IPv4 and IPv6 addresses assigned to network interface
              eth0.

          ip address add 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
              Adds an IPv6 address to network interface eth1.

          ip address delete 2001:0db8:85a3::0370:7334/64 dev eth1
              Delete the IPv6 address added above.

          ip address flush dev eth4 scope global
              Removes all global IPv4 and IPv6 addresses from device eth4.
              Without 'scope global' it would remove all addresses
              including IPv6 link-local ones.
