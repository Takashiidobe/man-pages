NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          rpm2archive - Create tar archive from RPM Package Manager (RPM)
          package.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          rpm2archive {-n|--nocompression} FILES


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          rpm2archive converts the .rpm files specified as arguments to tar
          files.  By default they are gzip compressed and saved with
          postfix ".tgz".

          If '-' is given as argument, an rpm stream is read from standard
          in and written to standard out.

          In opposite to rpm2cpio rpm2archive also works with RPM packages
          containing files greater than 4GB which are not supported by
          cpio.  Unless rpm2cpio rpm2archive needs a working rpm
          installation which limits its usefulness for some disaster
          recovery scenarios.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -n, --nocompression
                 Generate uncompressed tar archive and use ".tar" as
                 postfix of the file name.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          rpm2archive glint-1.0-1.i386.rpm ; tar -xvz
          glint-1.0-1.i386.rpm.tgz
          cat glint-1.0-1.i386.rpm | rpm2archive - | tar -tvz
