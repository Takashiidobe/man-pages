NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          key.dns_resolver - upcall for request-key to handle dns_resolver
          keys


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          /sbin/key.dns_resolver <key>
          /sbin/key.dns_resolver --dump-config [-c <configfile>]
          /sbin/key.dns_resolver -D [-v] [-v] [-c <configfile>] <desc>
          <calloutinfo>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This program is invoked by request-key on behalf of the kernel
          when kernel services (such as NFS, CIFS and AFS) want to perform
          a hostname lookup and the kernel does not have the key cached.
          It is not ordinarily intended to be called directly.

          There program has internal parameters that can be changed with a
          configuration file (see key.dns_resolver.conf(5) for more
          information).  The default configuration file is in /etc, but
          this can be overridden with the -c flag.

          The program can be called in debugging mode to test its
          functionality by passing a -D or --debug flag on the command
          line.  For this to work, the key description and the callout
          information must be supplied.  Verbosity can be increased by
          supplying one or more -v flags.

          The program may also be called with --dump-config to show the
          values that configurable parameters will have after parsing the
          config file.

          All errors will be logged to the syslog.
