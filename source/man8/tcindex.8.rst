NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          tcindex - traffic control index filter


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tc filter ... tcindex [ hash SIZE ] [ mask MASK ] [ shift SHIFT ]
                  [ pass_on | fall_through ] [ classid CLASSID ] [ action
                  ACTION_SPEC ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This filter allows to match packets based on their tcindex field
          value, i.e. the combination of the DSCP and ECN fields as present
          in IPv4 and IPv6 headers.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          action ACTION_SPEC
                 Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
                 matching packets.

          classid CLASSID
                 Push matching packets into the class identified by
                 CLASSID.

          hash SIZE
                 Hash table size in entries to use. Defaults to 64.

          mask MASK
                 An optional bitmask to binary AND to the packet's tcindex
                 field before use.

          shift SHIFT
                 The number of bits to right-shift a packet's tcindex value
                 before use. If a mask has been set, masking is done before
                 shifting.

          pass_on
                 If this flag is set, failure to find a class for the
                 resulting ID will make the filter fail and lead to the
                 next filter being consulted.

          fall_through
                 This is the opposite of pass_on and the default. The
                 filter will classify the packet even if there is no class
                 present for the resulting class ID.
