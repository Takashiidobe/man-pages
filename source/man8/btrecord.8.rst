   BTRECORD(8)                                                  BTRECORD(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          btrecord - recreate IO loads recorded by blktrace


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Usage:

          btrecord [ options ] <dev...>


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The btrecord and btreplay tools provide the ability to record and
          replay IOs captured by the blktrace utility. Attempts are made to
          maintain ordering, CPU mappings and time-separation of IOs.

          The blktrace utility provides the ability to collect detailed
          traces from the kernel for each IO processed by the block IO
          layer. The traces provide a complete timeline for each IO
          processed, including detailed information concerning when an IO
          was first received by the block IO layer — indicating the device,
          CPU number, time stamp, IO direction, sector number and IO size
          (number of sectors). Using this information, one is able to
          replay the IO again on the same machine or another set up
          entirely.

          The basic operating work-flow to replay IOs would be something
          like:

          -
              Run blktrace to collect traces. Here you specify the
              device or devices that you wish to trace and later replay IOs
            upon. Note:
              the only traces you are interested in are QUEUE requests —
              thus, to save system resources (including storage for
            traces), one could
              specify the -a queue command line option to blktrace.

          -
              While blktrace is running, you run the workload that you
              are interested in.

          -
              When the work load has completed, you stop the blktrace
              utility (thus saving all traces over the complete workload).

          -
              You extract the pertinent IO information from the traces
            saved by
              blktrace using the btrecord utility. This will parse
              each trace file created by blktrace, and crafty IO
            descriptions
              to be used in the next phase of the workload processing.

          -
              Once btrecord has successfully created a series of data
              files to be processed, you can run the btreplay utility which
              attempts to generate the same IOs seen during the sample
            workload phase.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -d <dir>
          --input-directory=<dir>
                 Set input directory.  This option requires a single
                 parameter providing the directory name for where input
                 files are to be found. The default directory is the
                 current directory (.).

          -D <dir>
          --output-directory=<dir>
                 Set output directory.  This option requires a single
                 parameter providing the directory name for where output
                 files are to be found. The default directory is the
                 current directory (.).

          -F
          --find-traces
                 Find trace files automatically This option instructs
                 btreplay to go find all the trace files in the directory
                 specified (either via the -d option, or in the default
                 directory (.).

          -h
          --help
                 Show help and exit.

          -V
          --version
                 Show version number and exit.

          -m <nanoseconds>
          --max-bunch-time=<nanoseconds>
                 The -m option requires a single parameter which specifies
                 an amount of time (in nanoseconds) to include in any one
                 bunch of IOs that are to be processed. The smaller the
                 value, the smaller the number of IOs processed at one time
                 — perhaps yielding in more realistic replay.  However,
                 after a certain point the amount of overhead per bunch may
                 result in additional real replay time, thus yielding less
                 accurate replay times.

                 The default value is 10,000,000 nanoseconds (10
                 milliseconds).

          -M <num>
          --max-pkts=<num>
                 Set maximum number of packets per bunch.  The -M option
                 requires a single parameter which specifies the maximum
                 number of IOs to store in a single bunch. As with the -m
                 option, smaller values may or may not yield more accurate
                 replay times.

                 The default value is 8, with a maximum value of up to 512
                 being supported.

          -o <basename>
          --output-base=<basename>
                 Set base name for output files.  Each output file has 3
                 fields:

                 1.
                     Device identifier (taken directly from the device name
                    of the
                     blktrace output file).

                 2.
                     btrecord base name — by default ``replay''.

                 3.
                     The CPU number (again, taken directly from the
                     blktrace output file name).

                 This option requires a single parameter that will override
                 the default name (replay), and replace it with the
                 specified value.

          -v
          --verbose
                 Enable verbose output.  This option will output some
                 simple statistics at the end of a successful run.  Example
                 output is:

                 sdab:0: 580661 pkts (tot), 126030 pkts (replay), 89809 bunches, 1.4 pkts/bunch
                 sdab:1: 2559775 pkts (tot), 430172 pkts (replay), 293029 bunches, 1.5 pkts/bunch
                 sdab:2: 653559 pkts (tot), 136522 pkts (replay), 102288 bunches, 1.3 pkts/bunch
                 sdab:3: 474773 pkts (tot), 117849 pkts (replay), 69572 bunches, 1.7 pkts/bunch

                 The meaning of the columns is:

                 1.
                      The first field contains the device name and CPU
                    identifier. Thus:
                      sdab:0: means the device sdab and traces on CPU 0.

                 2.
                      The second field contains the total number of packets
                    processed for each
                      device file.

                 3.
                      The next field shows the number of packets eligible
                    for replay.

                 4.
                      The fourth field contains the total number of IO
                    bunches.

                 5.
                      The last field shows the average number of IOs per
                    bunch recorded.
