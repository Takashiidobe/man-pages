---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The pedit action can be used to change arbitrary packet data. The
          location of data to change can either be specified by giving an
          offset and size as in RAW_OP, or for header values by naming the
          header and field to edit the size is then chosen automatically
          based on the header field size.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          ex     Use extended pedit.  EXTENDED_LAYERED_OP and the
                 add/decrement CMD_SPEC are allowed only in this mode.

          offset OFFSET { u32 | u16 | u8 }
                 Specify the offset at which to change data.  OFFSET is a
                 signed integer, it's base is automatically chosen (e.g.
                 hex if prefixed by 0x or octal if prefixed by 0).  The
                 second argument specifies the length of data to change,
                 that is four bytes (u32), two bytes (u16) or a single byte
                 (u8).

          at AT offmask MASK shift SHIFT
                 This is an optional part of RAW_OP which allows to have a
                 variable OFFSET depending on packet data at offset AT,
                 which is binary ANDed with MASK and right-shifted by SHIFT
                 before adding it to OFFSET.

          eth ETHHDR_FIELD
                 Change an ETH header field. The supported keywords for
                 ETHHDR_FIELD are:

                 src
                 dst    Source or destination MAC address in the standard
                        format: XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX

                 type   Ether-type in numeric value

          ip IPHDR_FIELD
                 Change an IPv4 header field. The supported keywords for
                 IPHDR_FIELD are:

                 src
                 dst    Source or destination IP address, a four-byte
                        value.

                 tos
                 dsfield
                 precedence
                        Type Of Service field, an eight-bit value.

                 ihl    Change the IP Header Length field, a four-bit
                        value.

                 protocol
                        Next-layer Protocol field, an eight-bit value.

                 nofrag
                 firstfrag
                 ce
                 df
                 mf     Change IP header flags. Note that the value to pass
                        to the set command is not just a bit value, but the
                        full byte including the flags field.  Though only
                        the relevant bits of that value are respected, the
                        rest ignored.

          ip BEYOND_IPHDR_FIELD
                 Supported only for non-extended layered op. It is passed
                 to the kernel as offsets relative to the beginning of the
                 IP header and assumes the IP header is of minimum size (20
                 bytes). The supported keywords for BEYOND_IPHDR_FIELD are:

                 dport
                 sport  Destination or source port numbers, a 16-bit value.
                        Indeed, IPv4 headers don't contain this
                        information. Instead, this will set an offset which
                        suits at least TCP and UDP if the IP header is of
                        minimum size (20 bytes). If not, this will do
                        unexpected things.

                 icmp_type
                 icmp_code
                        Again, this allows to change data past the actual
                        IP header itself. It assumes an ICMP header is
                        present immediately following the (minimal sized)
                        IP header.  If it is not or the latter is bigger
                        than the minimum of 20 bytes, this will do
                        unexpected things. These fields are eight-bit
                        values.

          ip EX_IPHDR_FIELD
                 Supported only when ex is used. The supported keywords for
                 EX_IPHDR_FIELD are:

                 ttl

          ip6 IP6HDR_FIELD
                 The supported keywords for IP6HDR_FIELD are:

                 src
                 dst
                 traffic_class
                 flow_lbl
                 payload_len
                 nexthdr
                 hoplimit

          tcp TCPHDR_FIELD
                 The supported keywords for TCPHDR_FIELD are:

                 sport
                 dport  Source or destination TCP port number, a 16-bit
                        value.

                 flags

          udp UDPHDR_FIELD
                 The supported keywords for UDPHDR_FIELD are:

                 sport
                 dport  Source or destination TCP port number, a 16-bit
                        value.

          clear  Clear the addressed data (i.e., set it to zero).

          invert Swap every bit in the addressed data.

          set VAL
                 Set the addressed data to a specific value. The size of
                 VAL is defined by either one of the u32, u16 or u8
                 keywords in RAW_OP, or the size of the addressed header
                 field in LAYERED_OP.

          add VAL
                 Add the addressed data by a specific value. The size of
                 VAL is defined by the size of the addressed header field
                 in EXTENDED_LAYERED_OP.  This operation is supported only
                 for extended layered op.

          decrement
                 Decrease the addressed data by one.  This operation is
                 supported only for ip ttl and ip6 hoplimit.

          preserve
                 Keep the addressed data as is.

          retain RVAL
                 This optional extra part of CMD_SPEC allows to exclude
                 bits from being changed. Supported only for 32 bits fields
                 or smaller.

          CONTROL
                 The following keywords allow to control how the tree of
                 qdisc, classes, filters and actions is further traversed
                 after this action.

                 reclassify
                        Restart with the first filter in the current list.

                 pipe   Continue with the next action attached to the same
                        filter.

                 drop
                 shot   Drop the packet.

                 continue
                        Continue classification with the next filter in
                        line.

                 pass   Finish classification process and return to calling
                        qdisc for further packet processing. This is the
                        default.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Being able to edit packet data, one could do all kinds of things,
          such as e.g.  implementing port redirection. Certainly not the
          most useful application, but as an example it should do:

          First, qdiscs need to be set up to attach filters to. For the
          receive path, a simple ingress qdisc will do, for transmit path a
          classful qdisc (HTB in this case) is necessary:

                 tc qdisc replace dev eth0 root handle 1: htb
                 tc qdisc add dev eth0 ingress handle ffff:

          Finally, a filter with pedit action can be added for each
          direction. In this case, u32 is used matching on the port number
          to redirect from, while pedit then does the actual rewriting:

                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent 1: u32 \
                      match ip dport 23 0xffff \
                      action pedit pedit munge ip dport set 22
                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                      match ip sport 22 0xffff \
                      action pedit pedit munge ip sport set 23
                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                      match ip sport 22 0xffff \
                      action pedit ex munge ip dst set 192.168.1.199
                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                      match ip sport 22 0xffff \
                      action pedit ex munge ip6 dst set fe80::dacb:8aff:fec7:320e
                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                      match ip sport 22 0xffff \
                      action pedit ex munge eth dst set 11:22:33:44:55:66
                 tc filter add dev eth0 parent ffff: u32 \
                      match ip dport 23 0xffff \
                      action pedit ex munge tcp dport set 22

          To rewrite just part of a field, use the retain directive. E.g.
          to overwrite the DSCP part of a dsfield with $DSCP, without
          touching ECN:

                 tc filter add dev eth0 ingress flower ... \
                      action pedit ex munge ip dsfield set $((DSCP << 2)) retain 0xfc

          And vice versa, to set ECN to e.g. 1 without impacting DSCP:

                 tc filter add dev eth0 ingress flower ... \
                      action pedit ex munge ip dsfield set 1 retain 0x3
