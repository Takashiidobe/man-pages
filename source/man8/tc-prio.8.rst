   PRIO(8)                           Linux                          PRIO(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          PRIO - Priority qdisc


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tc qdisc ... dev dev ( parent classid | root) [ handle major: ]
          prio [ bands bands ] [ priomap band band band...  ] [ estimator
          interval timeconstant ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The PRIO qdisc is a simple classful queueing discipline that
          contains an arbitrary number of classes of differing priority.
          The classes are dequeued in numerical descending order of
          priority. PRIO is a scheduler and never delays packets - it is a
          work-conserving qdisc, though the qdiscs contained in the classes
          may not be.

          Very useful for lowering latency when there is no need for
          slowing down traffic.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          On creation with 'tc qdisc add', a fixed number of bands is
          created. Each band is a class, although is not possible to add
          classes with 'tc qdisc add', the number of bands to be created
          must instead be specified on the command line attaching PRIO to
          its root.

          When dequeueing, band 0 is tried first and only if it did not
          deliver a packet does PRIO try band 1, and so onwards. Maximum
          reliability packets should therefore go to band 0, minimum delay
          to band 1 and the rest to band 2.

          As the PRIO qdisc itself will have minor number 0, band 0 is
          actually major:1, band 1 is major:2, etc. For major, substitute
          the major number assigned to the qdisc on 'tc qdisc add' with the
          handle parameter.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Three methods are available to PRIO to determine in which band a
          packet will be enqueued.

          From userspace
                 A process with sufficient privileges can encode the
                 destination class directly with SO_PRIORITY, see
                 socket(7).

          with a tc filter
                 A tc filter attached to the root qdisc can point traffic
                 directly to a class

          with the priomap
                 Based on the packet priority, which in turn is derived
                 from the Type of Service assigned to the packet.

          Only the priomap is specific to this qdisc.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          bands  Number of bands. If changed from the default of 3, priomap
                 must be updated as well.

          priomap
                 The priomap maps the priority of a packet to a class. The
                 priority can either be set directly from userspace, or be
                 derived from the Type of Service of the packet.

                 Determines how packet priorities, as assigned by the
                 kernel, map to bands. Mapping occurs based on the TOS
                 octet of the packet, which looks like this:

                 0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7
                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+
                 |           |               |   |
                 |PRECEDENCE |      TOS      |MBZ|
                 |           |               |   |
                 +---+---+---+---+---+---+---+---+

                 The four TOS bits (the 'TOS field') are defined as:

                 Binary Decimal  Meaning
                 -----------------------------------------
                 1000   8         Minimize delay (md)
                 0100   4         Maximize throughput (mt)
                 0010   2         Maximize reliability (mr)
                 0001   1         Minimize monetary cost (mmc)
                 0000   0         Normal Service

                 As there is 1 bit to the right of these four bits, the
                 actual value of the TOS field is double the value of the
                 TOS bits. Tcpdump -v -v shows you the value of the entire
                 TOS field, not just the four bits. It is the value you see
                 in the first column of this table:

                 TOS     Bits  Means                    Linux Priority    Band

                 0x1a    13    mmc+mt+md                4 Int. Bulk       1
                 0x1c    14    mr+mt+md                 4 Int. Bulk       1
                 0x1e    15    mmc+mr+mt+md             4 Int. Bulk       1

                 The second column contains the value of the relevant four
                 TOS bits, followed by their translated meaning. For
                 example, 15 stands for a packet wanting Minimal Monetary
                 Cost, Maximum Reliability, Maximum Throughput AND Minimum
                 Delay.

                 The fourth column lists the way the Linux kernel
                 interprets the TOS bits, by showing to which Priority they
                 are mapped.

                 The last column shows the result of the default priomap.
                 On the command line, the default priomap looks like this:

                     1 2 2 2 1 2 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1

                 This means that priority 4, for example, gets mapped to
                 band number 1.  The priomap also allows you to list higher
                 priorities (> 7) which do not correspond to TOS mappings,
                 but which are set by other means.

                 This table from RFC 1349 (read it for more details)
                 explains how applications might very well set their TOS
                 bits:

                 TELNET                   1000           (minimize delay)
                 FTP

                 TFTP                     1000           (minimize delay)

                         DATA phase       0100           (maximize throughput)

                         Zone Transfer    0100           (maximize throughput)

                 NNTP                     0001           (minimize monetary cost)

                 ICMP
                         Errors           0000
                         Requests         0000 (mostly)
                         Responses        <same as request> (mostly)


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          PRIO classes cannot be configured further - they are
          automatically created when the PRIO qdisc is attached. Each class
          however can contain yet a further qdisc.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Large amounts of traffic in the lower bands can cause starvation
          of higher bands. Can be prevented by attaching a shaper (for
          example, tc-tbf(8) to these bands to make sure they cannot
          dominate the link.
