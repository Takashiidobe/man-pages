NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ip-maddress - multicast addresses management


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ip [ OPTIONS ] maddress  { COMMAND | help }

          ip maddress [ add | del ] MULTIADDR dev NAME

          ip maddress show [ dev NAME ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          maddress objects are multicast addresses.

      ip maddress show - list multicast addresses
          dev NAME (default)
                 the device name.

          ip maddress add - add a multicast address

          ip maddress delete - delete a multicast address

                 These commands attach/detach a static link-layer multicast
                 address to listen on the interface.  Note that it is
                 impossible to join protocol multicast groups statically.
                 This command only manages link-layer addresses.

                 address LLADDRESS (default)
                        the link-layer multicast address.

                 dev NAME
                        the device to join/leave this multicast address.
