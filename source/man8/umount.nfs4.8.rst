   UMOUNT.NFS(8)            System Manager's Manual           UMOUNT.NFS(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          umount.nfs, umount.nfs4 - unmount a Network File System


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          umount.nfs dir [-fvnrlh ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          umount.nfs and umount.nfs4 are a part of nfs(5) utilities
          package, which provides NFS client functionality.

          umount.nfs4 and umount.nfs are meant to be used by the umount(8)
          command for unmounting NFS shares. This subcommand, however, can
          also be used as a standalone command with limited functionality.

          dir is the directory on which the file system is mounted.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -f     Force unmount the file system in case of unreachable NFS
                 system.

          -v     Be verbose.

          -n     Do not update /etc/mtab.  By default, an entry is created
                 in /etc/mtab for every mounted file system. Use this
                 option to skip deleting an entry.

          -r     In case unmounting fails, try to mount read-only.

          -l     Lazy unmount. Detach the file system from the file system
                 hierarchy now, and cleanup all references to the file
                 system as soon as it is not busy anymore.

          -h     Print help message.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          For further information please refer nfs(5) and umount(8) manual
          pages.
