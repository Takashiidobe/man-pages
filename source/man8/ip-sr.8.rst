   IP-SR(8)                          Linux                         IP-SR(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ip-sr - IPv6 Segment Routing management


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ip sr  { COMMAND | help }

          ip sr hmac show

          ip sr hmac set KEYID ALGO

          ip sr tunsrc show

          ip sr tunsrc set ADDRESS


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The ip sr command is used to configure IPv6 Segment Routing
          (SRv6) internal parameters.

          Those parameters include the mapping between an HMAC key ID and
          its associated hashing algorithm and secret, and the IPv6 address
          to use as source for encapsulated packets.

          The ip sr hmac set command prompts for a passphrase that will be
          used as the HMAC secret for the corresponding key ID. A blank
          passphrase removes the mapping.  The currently supported
          algorithms for ALGO are sha1 and sha256.

          If the tunnel source is set to the address :: (which is the
          default), then an address of the egress interface will be
          selected. As this operation may hinder performances, it is
          recommended to set a non-default address.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

      Configure an HMAC mapping for key ID 42 and hashing algorithm SHA-256
          # ip sr hmac set 42 sha256

      Set the tunnel source address to 2001:db8::1
          # ip sr tunsrc set 2001:db8::1
