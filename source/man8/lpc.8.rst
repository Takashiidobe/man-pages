NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          lpc - line printer control program (deprecated)


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          lpc [ command [ parameter(s) ] ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          lpc provides limited control over printer and class queues
          provided by CUPS. It can also be used to query the state of
          queues.

          If no command is specified on the command-line, lpc displays a
          prompt and accepts commands from the standard input.

      COMMANDS
          The lpc program accepts a subset of commands accepted by the
          Berkeley lpc program of the same name:

          exit Exits the command interpreter.

          help [command]

          ? [command]
               Displays a short help message.

          quit Exits the command interpreter.

          status [queue]
               Displays the status of one or more printer or class queues.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          This program is deprecated and will be removed in a future
          feature release of CUPS.

          Since lpc is geared towards the Berkeley printing system, it is
          impossible to use lpc to configure printer or class queues
          provided by CUPS.  To configure printer or class queues you must
          use the lpadmin(8) command or another CUPS-compatible client with
          that functionality.
