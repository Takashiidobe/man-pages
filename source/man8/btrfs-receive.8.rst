   BTRFS-RECEIVE(8)              Btrfs Manual              BTRFS-RECEIVE(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          btrfs-receive - receive subvolumes from send stream


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          btrfs receive [options] <path>

          or

          btrfs receive --dump [options]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Receive a stream of changes and replicate one or more subvolumes
          that were previously generated by btrfs send. The received
          subvolumes are stored to path, unless --dump option is given.

          If --dump option is specified, btrfs receive will only do the
          validation of the stream, and print the stream metadata, one
          operation per line.

          btrfs receive will fail in the following cases:

           1. receiving subvolume already exists

           2. previously received subvolume has been changed after it was
              received

           3. default subvolume has changed or you didn’t mount the
              filesystem at the toplevel subvolume

          A subvolume is made read-only after the receiving process
          finishes successfully (see BUGS below).

          Options

          -f <FILE>
              read the stream from <FILE> instead of stdin,

          -C|--chroot
              confine the process to path using chroot(1)

          -e
              terminate after receiving an end cmd marker in the stream.

              Without this option the receiver side terminates only in case
              of an error on end of file.

          -E|--max-errors <NERR>
              terminate as soon as NERR errors occur while stream
              processing commands from the stream

              Default value is 1. A value of 0 means no limit.

          -m <ROOTMOUNT>
              the root mount point of the destination filesystem

              By default the mountpoint is searched in /proc/self/mounts.
              If /proc is not accessible, eg. in a chroot environment, use
              this option to tell us where this filesystem is mounted.

          --dump
              dump the stream metadata, one line per operation

              Does not require the path parameter. The filesystem remains
              unchanged.

          -q|--quiet
              (deprecated) alias for global -q option

          -v
              (deprecated) alias for global -v option

          Global options

          -v|--verbose
              increase verbosity about performed actions, print details
              about each operation

          -q|--quiet
              suppress all messages except errors


-------------------------------------------------

::

          btrfs receive sets the subvolume read-only after it completes
          successfully. However, while the receive is in progress, users
          who have write access to files or directories in the receiving
          path can add, remove, or modify files, in which case the
          resulting read-only subvolume will not be an exact copy of the
          sent subvolume.

          If the intention is to create an exact copy, the receiving path
          should be protected from access by users until the receive
          operation has completed and the subvolume is set to read-only.

          Additionally, receive does not currently do a very good job of
          validating that an incremental send stream actually makes sense,
          and it is thus possible for a specially crafted send stream to
          create a subvolume with reflinks to arbitrary files in the same
          filesystem. Because of this, users are advised to not use btrfs
          receive on send streams from untrusted sources, and to protect
          trusted streams when sending them across untrusted networks.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          btrfs receive returns a zero exit status if it succeeds. Non zero
          is returned in case of failure.
