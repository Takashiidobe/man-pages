---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-time-wait-sync is a system service that delays the start
          of units that are ordered after time-sync.target (see
          systemd.special(7) for details) until the system time has been
          synchronized with an accurate remote reference time source by
          systemd-timesyncd.service.

          systemd-timesyncd.service notifies systemd-time-wait-sync about
          successful synchronization.  systemd-time-wait-sync also tries to
          detect when the kernel marks the system clock as synchronized,
          but this detection is not reliable and is intended only as a
          fallback for compatibility with alternative NTP services that can
          be used to synchronize time (e.g., ntpd, chronyd).


---------------------------------------------------

::

          /run/systemd/timesync/synchronized
              The presence of this file indicates to this service that the
              system clock has been synchronized.
