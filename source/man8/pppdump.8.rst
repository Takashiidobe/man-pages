   PPPDUMP(8)               System Manager's Manual              PPPDUMP(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          pppdump - convert PPP record file to readable format


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          pppdump [ -h | -p [ -d ]] [ -r ] [ -a ] [ -m mru ] [ file ...  ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The pppdump utility converts the files written using the record
          option of pppd into a human-readable format.  If one or more
          filenames are specified, pppdump will read each in turn;
          otherwise it will read its standard input.  In each case the
          result is written to standard output.

          The options are as follows:

          -h     Prints the bytes sent and received in hexadecimal.  If
                 neither this option nor the -p option is specified, the
                 bytes are printed as the characters themselves, with non-
                 printing and non-ASCII characters printed as escape
                 sequences.

          -p     Collects the bytes sent and received into PPP packets,
                 interpreting the async HDLC framing and escape characters
                 and checking the FCS (frame check sequence) of each
                 packet.  The packets are printed as hex values and as
                 characters (non-printable characters are printed as `.').

          -d     With the -p option, this option causes pppdump to
                 decompress packets which have been compressed with the
                 BSD-Compress or Deflate methods.

          -r     Reverses the direction indicators, so that `sent' is
                 printed for bytes or packets received, and `rcvd' is
                 printed for bytes or packets sent.

          -a     Prints absolute times.

          -m mru Use mru as the MRU (maximum receive unit) for both
                 directions of the link when checking for over-length PPP
                 packets (with the -p option).
