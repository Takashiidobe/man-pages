NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-backlight@.service, systemd-backlight - Load and save the
          display backlight brightness at boot and shutdown


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-backlight@.service

          /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight save [backlight|leds]:DEVICE

          /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-backlight load [backlight|leds]:DEVICE


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-backlight@.service is a service that restores the display
          backlight brightness at early boot and saves it at shutdown. On
          disk, the backlight brightness is stored in
          /var/lib/systemd/backlight/. During loading, if the udev property
          ID_BACKLIGHT_CLAMP is not set to false, the brightness is clamped
          to a value of at least 1 or 5% of maximum brightness, whichever
          is greater. This restriction will be removed when the kernel
          allows user space to reliably set a brightness value which does
          not turn off the display.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-backlight understands the following kernel command line
          parameter:

          systemd.restore_state=
              Takes a boolean argument. Defaults to "1". If "0", does not
              restore the backlight settings on boot. However, settings
              will still be stored on shutdown.
