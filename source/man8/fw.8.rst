   Firewall mark classifier in tc(8) LinuxFirewall mark classifier in tc(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          fw - fwmark traffic control filter


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tc filter ... fw [ classid CLASSID ] [ action ACTION_SPEC ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          the fw filter allows to classify packets based on a previously
          set fwmark by iptables.  If it is identical to the filter's
          handle, the filter matches.  iptables allows to mark single
          packets with the MARK target, or whole connections using
          CONNMARK.  The benefit of using this filter instead of doing the
          heavy-lifting with tc itself is that on one hand it might be
          convenient to keep packet filtering and classification in one
          place, possibly having to match a packet just once, and on the
          other users familiar with iptables but not tc will have a less
          hard time adding QoS to their setups.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          classid CLASSID
                 Push matching packets to the class identified by CLASSID.

          action ACTION_SPEC
                 Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
                 matching packets.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Take e.g. the following tc filter statement:

                 tc filter add ... handle 6 fw classid 1:1

          will match if the packet's fwmark value is 6.  This is a sample
          iptables statement marking packets coming in on eth0:

                 iptables -t mangle -A PREROUTING -i eth0 -j MARK --set-mark 6
