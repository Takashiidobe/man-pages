          mcs - Multi-Category System


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          MCS (Multiple Category System) allows users to label files on
          their system within administrator defined categories.  It then
          uses SELinux Mandatory Access Control to protect those files.
          MCS is a discretionary model to allow users to mark their data
          with additional tags that further restrict access.  The only
          mandatory aspect is authorizing users for categories by defining
          their clearance in policy.  However, MCS is similar to MLS and
          exercises the same code paths and share the same support
          infrastructure.  They just differ in their specific
          configuration.

          The /etc/selinux/{SELINUXTYPE}/setrans.conf configuration file
          translates the labels on disk to human readable form.
          Administrators can define any labels they want in this file.
          Certain applications like printing and auditing will use these
          labels to identify the files.  By setting a category on a file
          you will prevent other applications/services from having access
          to the files.

          Examples of file labels would be PatientRecord,
          CompanyConfidential etc.
