NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          lloadd - LDAP Load Balancer Daemon


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          LIBEXECDIR/lloadd [-4|-6] [-d debug-level] [-f lloadd-config-
          file] [-h URLs] [-n service-name] [-s syslog-level] [-l syslog-
          local-user] [-o option[=value]] [-r directory] [-u user]
          [-g group]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Lloadd is the stand-alone LDAP daemon. It listens for LDAP
          connections on any number of ports (default 389), forwarding the
          LDAP operations it receives over these connections to be handled
          by the configured backends.  lloadd is typically invoked at boot
          time, usually out of /etc/rc.local.  Upon startup, lloadd
          normally forks and disassociates itself from the invoking tty.
          If configured in the config file, the lloadd process will print
          its process ID (see getpid(2)) to a .pid file, as well as the
          command line options during invocation to an .args file (see
          lloadd.conf(5)).  If the -d flag is given, even with a zero
          argument, lloadd will not fork and disassociate from the invoking
          tty.

          See the "OpenLDAP Administrator's Guide" for more details on
          lloadd.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -4     Listen on IPv4 addresses only.

          -6     Listen on IPv6 addresses only.

          -d debug-level
                 Turn on debugging as defined by debug-level.  If this
                 option is specified, even with a zero argument, lloadd
                 will not fork or disassociate from the invoking terminal.
                 Some general operation and status messages are printed for
                 any value of debug-level.  debug-level is taken as a bit
                 string, with each bit corresponding to a different kind of
                 debugging information.  See <ldap_log.h> for details.
                 Comma-separated arrays of friendly names can be specified
                 to select debugging output of the corresponding debugging
                 information.  All the names recognized by the loglevel
                 directive described in lloadd.conf(5) are supported.  If
                 debug-level is ?, a list of installed debug-levels is
                 printed, and lloadd exits.

                 Remember that if you turn on packet logging, packets
                 containing bind passwords will be output, so if you
                 redirect the log to a logfile, that file should be read-
                 protected.

          -s syslog-level
                 This option tells lloadd at what debug-level debugging
                 statements should be logged to the syslog(8) facility.
                 The value syslog-level can be set to any value or
                 combination allowed by the -d switch.  Lloadd logs all
                 messages selected by syslog-level at the syslog(3)
                 severity debug-level DEBUG, on the unit specified with -l.

          -n service-name
                 Specifies the service name for logging and other purposes.
                 Defaults to basename of argv[0], i.e.: "lloadd".

          -l syslog-local-user
                 Selects the local user of the syslog(8) facility. Value
                 can be LOCAL0, through LOCAL7, as well as USER and DAEMON.
                 The default is LOCAL4.  However, this option is only
                 permitted on systems that support local users with the
                 syslog(8) facility.  Logging to syslog(8) occurs at the
                 "DEBUG" severity debug-level.

          -f lloadd-config-file
                 Specifies the lloadd configuration file. The default is
                 ETCDIR/lloadd.conf.

          -h URLlist
                 lloadd will by default serve ldap:/// (LDAP over TCP on
                 all interfaces on default LDAP port).  That is, it will
                 bind using INADDR_ANY and port 389.  The -h option may be
                 used to specify LDAP (and other scheme) URLs to serve.
                 For example, if lloadd is given -h "ldap://127.0.0.1:9009/
                 ldaps:/// ldapi:///", it will listen on 127.0.0.1:9009 for
                 LDAP, 0.0.0.0:636 for LDAP over TLS, and LDAP over IPC
                 (Unix domain sockets).  Host 0.0.0.0 represents INADDR_ANY
                 (any interface).  A space separated list of URLs is
                 expected.  The URLs should be of the LDAP, PLDAP, LDAPS,
                 PLDAPS, or LDAPI schemes, and generally without a DN or
                 other optional parameters (excepting as discussed below).
                 Support for the latter three schemes depends on selected
                 configuration options. Hosts may be specified by name or
                 IPv4 and IPv6 address formats.  Ports, if specified, must
                 be numeric.  The default ldap:// port is 389 and the
                 default ldaps:// port is 636, same for the proxy enabled
                 variants.

                 The PLDAP and PLDAPS URL schemes provide support for the
                 HAProxy proxy protocol version 2, which allows a load
                 balancer or proxy server to provide the remote client IP
                 address to slapd to be used for access control or logging.
                 Ports configured for PLDAP or PLDAPS will only accept
                 connections that include the necessary proxy protocol
                 header. Connections to these ports should be restricted at
                 the network level to only trusted load balancers or
                 proxies to avoid spoofing of client IP addresses by third
                 parties.

                 At the moment, the load balancer does not act on the
                 recorded address in any way.

                 For LDAP over IPC, name is the name of the socket, and no
                 port is required, nor allowed; note that directory
                 separators must be URL-encoded, like any other characters
                 that are special to URLs; so the socket

                         /usr/local/var/ldapi

                 must be specified as

                         ldapi://%2Fusr%2Flocal%2Fvar%2Fldapi

                 The default location for the IPC socket is
                 LOCALSTATEDIR/run/ldapi

          -r directory
                 Specifies a directory to become the root directory.
                 lloadd will change the current working directory to this
                 directory and then chroot(2) to this directory.  This is
                 done after opening listeners but before reading any
                 configuration file or initializing any backend.  When used
                 as a security mechanism, it should be used in conjunction
                 with -u and -g options.

          -u user
                 lloadd will run lloadd with the specified user name or id,
                 and that user's supplementary group access list as set
                 with initgroups(3).  The group ID is also changed to this
                 user's gid, unless the -g option is used to override.
                 Note when used with -r, lloadd will use the user database
                 in the change root environment.

          -g group
                 lloadd will run with the specified group name or id.  Note
                 when used with -r, lloadd will use the group database in
                 the change root environment.

          -o option[=value]
                 This option provides a generic means to specify options
                 without the need to reserve a separate letter for them.

                 It supports the following options:

                 slp={on|off|slp-attrs}
                        When SLP support is compiled into lloadd, disable
                        it (off),
                         enable it by registering at SLP DAs without
                        specific SLP attributes (on), or with specific SLP
                        attributes slp-attrs that must be an SLP attribute
                        list definition according to the SLP standard.

                        For example, "slp=(tree=production),(server-
                        type=OpenLDAP),(server-version=2.4.15)" registers
                        at SLP DAs with the three SLP attributes tree,
                        server-type and server-version that have the values
                        given above.  This allows one to specifically query
                        the SLP DAs for LDAP servers holding the production
                        tree in case multiple trees are available.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Lloadd can be compiled as a slapd loadable module. In that case,
          it can be loaded as such:

              moduleload path/to/lloadd.la
              backend lload
              listen "listening URLs"

          This enables lloadd to provide additional features through the
          host slapd process like access to run-time statistics in
          cn=monitor and dynamic configuration from cn=config.

          The listening sockets specified will be under direct control of
          lloadd and need to be different from the sockets slapd is
          configured to listen on.  Clients connecting to these are
          completely separate from regular LDAP clients connecting to the
          usual slapd sockets - lloadd clients have no access to slapd
          databases, similarly, slapd client traffic does not propagate to
          the lloadd backend servers in any way.


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          As part of lloadd's cn=monitor interface it is possible to close
          a client connection it manages by writing to the corresponding
          entry, replacing the olmConnectionState attribute with the value
          closing.  This is subject to ACLs configured on the monitor
          database. The server will send a Notice of Disconnection to the
          client, refuse any new operations and once all pending operations
          have finished, close the connection.

          For example, to close connection number 42:

              dn: cn=connection 42,cn=incoming connections,cn=load balancer,cn=backends,cn=monitor
              changetype: modify
              replace: olmConnectionState
              olmConnectionState: closing


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          To start lloadd and have it fork and detach from the terminal and
          start load-balancing the LDAP servers defined in the default
          config file, just type:

               LIBEXECDIR/lloadd

          To start lloadd with an alternate configuration file, and turn on
          voluminous debugging which will be printed on standard error,
          type:

               LIBEXECDIR/lloadd -f /var/tmp/lloadd.conf -d 255

          To start lloadd as a module inside a slapd process listening on
          ldap://:1389 and ldaps://, put the following in your slapd.conf
          (or its equivalent in cn=config):

              moduleload lloadd.la
              backend lload
              listen "ldap://:1389 ldaps://"
