   TC(8)                             Linux                            TC(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ETS - Enhanced Transmission Selection scheduler


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tc qdisc ... ets [ bands number ] [ strict number ] [ quanta
          bytes bytes bytes...  ] [ priomap band band band...  ]

          tc class ... ets [ quantum bytes ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The Enhanced Transmission Selection scheduler is a classful
          queuing discipline that merges functionality of PRIO and DRR
          qdiscs in one scheduler. ETS makes it easy to configure a set of
          strict and bandwidth-sharing bands to implement the transmission
          selection described in 802.1Qaz.

          On creation with 'tc qdisc add', a fixed number of bands is
          created. Each band is a class, although it is not possible to
          directly add and remove bands with 'tc class' commands. The
          number of bands to be created must instead be specified on the
          command line as the qdisc is added.

          The minor number of classid to use when referring to a band is
          the band number increased by one. Thus band 0 will have classid
          of major:1, band 1 that of major:2, etc.

          ETS bands are of two types: some number may be in strict mode,
          the remaining ones are in bandwidth-sharing mode.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          When dequeuing, strict bands are tried first, if there are any.
          Band 0 is tried first. If it did not deliver a packet, band 1 is
          tried next, and so on until one of the bands delivers a packet,
          or the strict bands are exhausted.

          If no packet has been dequeued from any of the strict bands, if
          there are any bandwidth-sharing bands, the dequeuing proceeds
          according to the DRR algorithm. Each bandwidth-sharing band is
          assigned a deficit counter, initialized to quantum assigned by a
          quanta element. ETS maintains an (internal) ''active'' list of
          bandwidth-sharing bands whose qdiscs are non-empty. This list is
          used for dequeuing. A packet is dequeued from the band at the
          head of the list if the packet size is smaller or equal to the
          deficit counter. If the counter is too small, it is increased by
          quantum and the scheduler moves on to the next band in the active
          list.

          Only qdiscs that own their queue should be added below the
          bandwidth-sharing bands. Attaching to them non-work-conserving
          qdiscs like TBF does not make sense -- other qdiscs in the active
          list will be skipped until the dequeue operation succeeds. This
          limitation does not exist with the strict bands.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The ETS qdisc allows three ways to decide which band to enqueue a
          packet to:

          - Packet priority can be directly set to a class handle, in which
          case that
            is the queue where the packet will be put. For example, band
          number 2 of
            a qdisc with handle of 11: will have classid 11:3. To mark a
          packet for
            queuing to this band, the packet priority should be set to
          0x110003.

          - A tc filter attached to the qdisc can put the packet to a band
          by using
            the flowid keyword.

          - As a last resort, the ETS qdisc consults its priomap (see
          below), which
            maps packets to bands based on packet priority.


-------------------------------------------------------------

::

          strict The number of bands that should be created in strict mode.
                 If not given, this value is 0.

          quanta Each bandwidth-sharing band needs to know its quantum,
                 which is the amount of bytes a band is allowed to dequeue
                 before the scheduler moves to the next bandwidth-sharing
                 band. The quanta argument lists quanta for the individual
                 bandwidth-sharing bands.  The minimum value of each
                 quantum is 1. If quanta is not given, the default is no
                 bandwidth-sharing bands, but note that when specifying a
                 large number of bands, the extra ones are in bandwidth-
                 sharing mode by default.

          bands  Number of bands given explicitly. This value has to be at
                 least large enough to cover the strict bands specified
                 through the strict keyword and bandwidth-sharing bands
                 specified in quanta.  If a larger value is given, any
                 extra bands are in bandwidth-sharing mode, and their
                 quanta are deduced from the interface MTU. If no value is
                 given, as many bands are created as necessary to cover all
                 bands implied by the strict and quanta keywords.

          priomap
                 The priomap maps the priority of a packet to a band. The
                 argument is a list of numbers. The first number indicates
                 which band the packets with priority 0 should be put to,
                 the second is for priority 1, and so on.

                 There can be up to 16 numbers in the list. If there are
                 fewer, the default band that traffic with one of the
                 unmentioned priorities goes to is the last one.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Add a qdisc with 8 bandwidth-sharing bands, using the interface
          MTU as their quanta. Since all quanta are the same, this will
          lead to equal distribution of bandwidth between the bands, each
          will get about 12.5% of the link. The low 8 priorities go to
          individual bands in a reverse 1:1 fashion (such that the highest
          priority goes to the first band).

          # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: ets bands 8 priomap 7 6 5
          4 3 2 1 0
          # tc qdisc show dev eth0
          qdisc ets 1: root refcnt 2 bands 8 quanta 1514 1514 1514 1514
          1514 1514 1514 1514 priomap 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

          Tweak the first band of the above qdisc to give it a quantum of
          2650, which will give it about 20% of the link (and about 11.5%
          to the remaining bands):

          # tc class change dev eth0 classid 1:1 ets quantum 2650
          # tc qdisc show dev eth0
          qdisc ets 1: root refcnt 2 bands 8 quanta 2650 1514 1514 1514
          1514 1514 1514 1514 priomap 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

          Create a purely strict Qdisc with reverse 1:1 mapping between
          priorities and bands:

          # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: ets strict 8 priomap 7 6 5
          4 3 2 1 0
          # tc qdisc sh dev eth0
          qdisc ets 1: root refcnt 2 bands 8 strict 8 priomap 7 6 5 4 3 2 1
          0 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7

          Add a Qdisc with 6 bands, 3 strict and 3 ETS with 35%-30%-25%
          weights:

          # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: ets strict 3 quanta 3500
          3000 2500 priomap 0 1 1 1 2 3 4 5
          # tc qdisc sh dev eth0
          qdisc ets 1: root refcnt 2 bands 6 strict 3 quanta 3500 3000 2500
          priomap 0 1 1 1 2 3 4 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5 5

          Create a Qdisc such that traffic with priorities 2, 3 and 4 are
          strictly prioritized over other traffic, and the rest goes into
          bandwidth-sharing classes with equal weights:

          # tc qdisc add dev eth0 root handle 1: ets bands 8 strict 3
          priomap 3 4 0 1 2 5 6 7
          # tc qdisc sh dev eth0
          qdisc ets 1: root refcnt 2 bands 8 strict 3 quanta 1514 1514 1514
          1514 1514 priomap 3 4 0 1 2 5 6 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7 7
