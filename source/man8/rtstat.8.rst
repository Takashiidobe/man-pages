   LNSTAT(8)                System Manager's Manual               LNSTAT(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          lnstat - unified linux network statistics


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          lnstat [options]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This manual page documents briefly the lnstat command.

          lnstat is a generalized and more feature-complete replacement for
          the old rtstat program. It is commonly used to periodically print
          a selection of statistical values exported by the kernel.  In
          addition to routing cache statistics, it supports any kind of
          statistics the linux kernel exports via a file in
          /proc/net/stat/.

          Each file in /proc/net/stat/ contains a header line listing the
          column names.  These names are used by lnstat as keys for
          selecting which statistics to print. For every CPU present in the
          system, a line follows which lists the actual values for each
          column of the file. lnstat sums these values up (which in fact
          are counters) before printing them. After each interval, only the
          difference to the last value is printed.

          Files and columns may be selected by using the -f and -k
          parameters. By default, all columns of all files are printed.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          lnstat supports the following options.

          -h, --help
                 Show summary of options.

          -V, --version
                 Show version of program.

          -c, --count <count>
                 Print <count> number of intervals.

          -d, --dump
                 Dump list of available files/keys.

          -f, --file <file>
                 Statistics file to use, may be specified multiple times.
                 By default all files in /proc/net/stat are scanned.

          -i, --interval <intv>
                 Set interval to 'intv' seconds.

          -j, --json
                 Display results in JSON format

          -k, --keys k,k,k,...
                 Display only keys specified. Each key k is of the form
                 [file:]key. If <file> is given, the search for the given
                 key is limited to that file. Otherwise the first file
                 containing the searched key is being used.

          -s, --subject [0-2]
                 Specify display of subject/header. '0' means no header at
                 all, '1' prints a header only at start of the program and
                 '2' prints a header every 20 lines.

          -w, --width n,n,n,...
                 Width for each field.


---------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          # lnstat -d
                 Get a list of supported statistics files.

          # lnstat -k arp_cache:entries,rt_cache:in_hit,arp_cache:destroys
                 Select the specified files and keys.

          # lnstat -i 10
                 Use an interval of 10 seconds.

          # lnstat -f ip_conntrack
                 Use only the specified file for statistics.

          # lnstat -s 0
                 Do not print a header at all.

          # lnstat -s 20
                 Print a header at start and every 20 lines.

          # lnstat -c -1 -i 1 -f rt_cache -k entries,in_hit,in_slow_tot
                 Display statistics for keys entries, in_hit and
                 in_slow_tot of field rt_cache every second.

::

          /proc/net/stat/arp_cache, /proc/net/stat/ndisc_cache

                 forced_gc_runs How many forced garbage collection runs
                 were executed. Happens when adding an entry and the table

                 unresolved_discards How many neighbor table entries were
                 discarded due to lookup failure.

                 table_fulls Number of table overflows. Happens if table is

                 insert_failed Number of entries for which list insertion
                 was attempted but failed (happens if the same entry is
                 already present).

                 drop Number of packets dropped due to conntrack failure.
                 Either new conntrack entry allocation failed, or protocol
                 helper dropped the packet.

                 early_drop Number of dropped conntrack entries to make
                 room for new ones, if maximum table size was reached.

                 icmp_error Number of packets which could not be tracked
                 due to error situation. This is a subset of invalid.

                 zero.

                 gc_ignored Number of ignored garbage collection runs due
                 to minimum GC interval not reached and routing cache not
                 full. Deprecated since IP route cache removal, therefore
