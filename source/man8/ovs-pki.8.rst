   ovs-pki(8)                 Open vSwitch Manual                ovs-pki(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ovs-pki - OpenFlow public key infrastructure management utility


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Each command takes the form:

          ovs-pki [options] command [args]

          The implemented commands and their arguments are:
          ovs-pki init
          ovs-pki req name
          ovs-pki sign name [type]
          ovs-pki req+sign name [type]
          ovs-pki verify name [type]
          ovs-pki fingerprint file
          ovs-pki self-sign name

          Each type above is a certificate type, either switch (default) or
          controller.

          The available options are:
          [-k type | --key=type]
          [-B nbits | --bits=nbits]
          [-D file | --dsaparam=file]
          [-b | --batch]
          [-f | --force]
          [-d dir | --dir=dir]
          [-l file | --log=file]
          [-u | --unique]
          [-h | --help]

          Some options do not apply to every command.


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The ovs-pki program sets up and manages a public key
          infrastructure for use with OpenFlow.  It is intended to be a
          simple interface for organizations that do not have an
          established public key infrastructure.  Other PKI tools can
          substitute for or supplement the use of ovs-pki.

          ovs-pki uses openssl(1) for certificate management and key
          generation.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------

::

          The following ovs-pki commands support manual PKI administration:

          init   Initializes a new PKI (by default in directory
                 /usr/local/var/lib/openvswitch/pki) and populates it with
                 a pair of certificate authorities for controllers and
                 switches.

                 This command should ideally be run on a high-security
                 machine separate from any OpenFlow controller or switch,
                 called the CA machine.  The files
                 pki/controllerca/cacert.pem and pki/switchca/cacert.pem
                 that it produces will need to be copied over to the
                 OpenFlow switches and controllers, respectively.  Their
                 contents may safely be made public.

                 By default, ovs-pki generates 2048-bit RSA keys.  The -B
                 or --bits option (see below) may be used to override the
                 key length.  The -k dsa or --key=dsa option may be used to
                 use DSA in place of RSA.  If DSA is selected, the
                 dsaparam.pem file generated in the new PKI hierarchy must
                 be copied to any machine on which the req command (see
                 below) will be executed.  Its contents may safely be made
                 public.

                 Other files generated by init may remain on the CA
                 machine.  The files pki/controllerca/private/cakey.pem and
                 pki/switchca/private/cakey.pem have particularly sensitive
                 contents that should not be exposed.

          req name
                 Generates a new private key named name-privkey.pem and
                 corresponding certificate request named name-req.pem.  The
                 private key can be intended for use by a switch or a
                 controller.

                 This command should ideally be run on the switch or
                 controller that will use the private key to identify
                 itself.  The file name-req.pem must be copied to the CA
                 machine for signing with the sign command (below).

                 This command will output a fingerprint to stdout as its
                 final step.  Write down the fingerprint and take it to the
                 CA machine before continuing with the sign step.

                 When RSA keys are in use (as is the default), req, unlike
                 the rest of ovs-pki's commands, does not need access to a
                 PKI hierarchy created by ovs-pki init.  The -B or --bits
                 option (see below) may be used to specify the number of
                 bits in the generated RSA key.

                 When DSA keys are used (as specified with --key=dsa), req
                 needs access to the dsaparam.pem file created as part of
                 the PKI hierarchy (but not to other files in that tree).
                 By default, ovs-pki looks for this file in
                 /usr/local/var/lib/openvswitch/pki/dsaparam.pem, but the
                 -D or --dsaparam option (see below) may be used to specify
                 an alternate location.

                 name-privkey.pem has sensitive contents that should not be
                 exposed.  name-req.pem may be safely made public.

          sign name [type]
                 Signs the certificate request named name-req.pem that was
                 produced in the previous step, producing a certificate
                 named name-cert.pem.  type, either switch (default) or
                 controller, indicates the use for which the key is being
                 certified.

                 This command must be run on the CA machine.

                 The command will output a fingerprint to stdout and
                 request that you verify that it is the same fingerprint
                 output by the req command.  This ensures that the request
                 being signed is the same one produced by req.  (The -b or
                 --batch option suppresses the verification step.)

                 The file name-cert.pem will need to be copied back to the
                 switch or controller for which it is intended.  Its
                 contents may safely be made public.

          req+sign name [type]
                 Combines the req and sign commands into a single step,
                 outputting all the files produced by each.  The
                 name-privkey.pem and name-cert.pem files must be copied
                 securely to the switch or controller.  name-privkey.pem
                 has sensitive contents and must not be exposed in transit.
                 Afterward, it should be deleted from the CA machine.

                 This combined method is, theoretically, less secure than
                 the individual steps performed separately on two different
                 machines, because there is additional potential for
                 exposure of the private key.  However, it is also more
                 convenient.

          verify name [type]
                 Verifies that name-cert.pem is a valid certificate for the
                 given type of use, either switch (default) or controller.
                 If the certificate is valid for this use, it prints the
                 message ``name-cert.pem: OK''; otherwise, it prints an
                 error message.

          fingerprint file
                 Prints the fingerprint for file.  If file is a
                 certificate, then this is the SHA-1 digest of the DER
                 encoded version of the certificate; otherwise, it is the
                 SHA-1 digest of the entire file.

          self-sign name
                 Signs the certificate request named name-req.pem using the
                 private key name-privkey.pem, producing a self-signed
                 certificate named name-cert.pem.  The input files should
                 have been produced with ovs-pki req.

                 Some controllers accept such self-signed certificates.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -k type
          --key=type
                 For the init command, sets the public key algorithm to use
                 for the new PKI hierarchy.  For the req and req+sign
                 commands, sets the public key algorithm to use for the key
                 to be generated, which must match the value specified on
                 init.  With other commands, the value has no effect.

                 The type may be rsa (the default) or dsa.

          -B nbits
          --bits=nbits
                 Sets the number of bits in the key to be generated.  When
                 RSA keys are in use, this option affects only the init,
                 req, and req+sign commands, and the same value should be
                 given each time.  With DSA keys are in use, this option
                 affects only the init command.

                 The value must be at least 1024.  The default is 2048.

          -D file
          --dsaparam=file
                 Specifies an alternate location for the dsaparam.pem file
                 required by the req and req+sign commands.  This option
                 affects only these commands, and only when DSA keys are
                 used.

                 The default is dsaparam.pem under the PKI hierarchy.

          -b
          --batch
                 Suppresses the interactive verification of fingerprints
                 that the sign command by default requires.

          -d dir
          --dir=dir
                 Specifies the location of the PKI hierarchy to be used or
                 created by the command (default:
                 /usr/local/var/lib/openvswitch/pki).  All commands, except
                 req, need access to a PKI hierarchy.

          -f
          --force
                 By default, ovs-pki will not overwrite existing files or
                 directories.  This option overrides this behavior.

          -l file
          --log=file
                 Sets the log file to file.  Default:
                 /usr/local/var/log/openvswitch/ovs-pki.log.

          -u
          --unique
                 Changes the format of the certificate's Common Name (CN)
                 field; by default, this field has the format "<name>
                 id:<uuid-or-date>", this option causes the provided name
                 to be treated as unique and changes the format of the CN
                 field to be simply "<name>".

          -h
          --help Prints a help usage message and exits.
