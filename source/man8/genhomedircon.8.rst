NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          genhomedircon - generate SELinux file context configuration
          entries for user home directories


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          genhomedircon is a script that executes semodule to rebuild the
          currently active SELinux policy (without reloading it) and to
          create the labels for each user home directory based on directory
          paths returned by calls to getpwent().

          The latter functionality depends on the "usepasswd" parameter
          being set to "true" (default) in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

          This script is usually executed by semanage although this default
          behavior can be optionally modified by setting to "true" the
          "disable-genhomedircon" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.

          Directories can be excluded from the list of home directories by
          the setting "ignoredirs" in /etc/selinux/semanage.conf.
