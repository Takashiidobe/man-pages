   Route classifier in tc(8)         Linux        Route classifier in tc(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          route - route traffic control filter


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          tc filter ... route [ from REALM | fromif TAG ] [ to REALM ] [
                  classid CLASSID ] [ action ACTION_SPEC ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Match packets based on routing table entries. This filter centers
          around the possibility to assign a realm to routing table
          entries. For any packet to be classified by this filter, a
          routing table lookup is performed and the returned realm is used
          to decide on whether the packet is a match or not.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          action ACTION_SPEC
                 Apply an action from the generic actions framework on
                 matching packets.

          classid CLASSID
                 Push matching packets into the class identified by
                 CLASSID.

          from REALM
          fromif TAG
                 Perform source route lookups.  TAG is the name of an
                 interface which must be present on the system at the time
                 of tc invocation.

          to REALM
                 Match if normal (i.e., destination) routing returns the
                 given REALM.


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          Consider the subnet 192.168.2.0/24 being attached to eth0:

                 ip route add 192.168.2.0/24 dev eth0 realm 2

          The following route filter will then match packets from that
          subnet:

                 tc filter add ... route from 2 classid 1:2

          and pass packets on to class 1:2.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Due to implementation details, realm values must be in a range
          from 0 to 255, inclusive. Alternatively, a verbose name defined
          in /etc/iproute2/rt_realms may be given instead.
