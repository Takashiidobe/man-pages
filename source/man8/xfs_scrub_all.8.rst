   xfs_scrub_all(8)         System Manager's Manual        xfs_scrub_all(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          xfs_scrub_all - scrub all mounted XFS filesystems


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          xfs_scrub_all [ -hV ]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          xfs_scrub_all attempts to read and check all the metadata on all
          mounted XFS filesystems.  The online scrub is performed via the
          xfs_scrub tool, either by running it directly or by using systemd
          to start it in a restricted fashion.  Mounted filesystems are
          mapped to physical storage devices so that scrub operations can
          be run in parallel so long as no two scrubbers access the same
          device simultaneously.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -h     Display help.

          -V     Prints the version number and exits.


-----------------------------------------------------------

::

          The exit code returned by xfs_scrub_all is the sum of the
          following conditions:
               0    - No errors
               4    - File system errors left uncorrected
               8    - Operational error
               16   - Usage or syntax error

          These are the same error codes returned by xfs_scrub.
