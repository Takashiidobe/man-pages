NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          ip-token - tokenized interface identifier support


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          ip token { COMMAND | help }

          ip token set TOKEN dev DEV

          ip token del dev DEV

          ip token get [ dev DEV ]

          ip token [ list ]

          IPv6 tokenized interface identifier support is used for assigning
          well-known host-part addresses to nodes whilst still obtaining a
          global network prefix from Router advertisements. The primary
          target for tokenized identifiers are server platforms where
          addresses are usually manually configured, rather than using
          DHCPv6 or SLAAC. By using tokenized identifiers, hosts can still
          determine their network prefix by use of SLAAC, but more readily
          be automatically renumbered should their network prefix change
          [1]. Tokenized IPv6 Identifiers are described in the draft [1]:
          <draft-chown-6man-tokenised-ipv6-identifiers-02>.

      ip token set - set an interface token
          set the interface token to the kernel.

          TOKEN  the interface identifier token address.

          dev DEV
                 the networking interface.

      ip token del - delete an interface token
          delete the interface token from the kernel.

          dev DEV
                 the networking interface.

      ip token get - get the interface token from the kernel
          show a tokenized interface identifier of a particular networking
          device.  Arguments: coincide with the arguments of ip token set
          but the TOKEN must be left out.

      ip token list - list all interface tokens
          list all tokenized interface identifiers for the networking
          interfaces from the kernel.
