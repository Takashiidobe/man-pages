   ANACRON(8)                System Administration               ANACRON(8)

NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          anacron - runs commands periodically


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          anacron [-s] [-f] [-n] [-d] [-q] [-t anacrontab] [-S spooldir]
          [job]
          anacron [-S spooldir] -u [-t anacrontab] [job]
          anacron [-V|-h]
          anacron -T [-t anacrontab]


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          Anacron is used to execute commands periodically, with a
          frequency specified in days.  Unlike cron(8), it does not assume
          that the machine is running continuously.  Hence, it can be used
          on machines that are not running 24 hours a day to control
          regular jobs as daily, weekly, and monthly jobs.

          Anacron reads a list of jobs from the /etc/anacrontab
          configuration file (see anacrontab(5)).  This file contains the
          list of jobs that Anacron controls.  Each job entry specifies a
          period in days, a delay in minutes, a unique job identifier, and
          a shell command.

          For each job, Anacron checks whether this job has been executed
          in the last n days, where n is the time period specified for that
          job.  If a job has not been executed in n days or more, Anacron
          runs the job's shell command, after waiting for the number of
          minutes specified as the delay parameter.

          After the command exits, Anacron records the date (excludes the
          hour) in a special timestamp file for that job, so it knows when
          to execute that job again.

          When there are no more jobs to be run, Anacron exits.

          Anacron only considers jobs whose identifier, as specified in
          anacrontab(5), matches any of the job command-line arguments.
          The job command-line arguments can be represented by shell
          wildcard patterns (be sure to protect them from your shell with
          adequate quoting).  Specifying no job command-line arguments is
          equivalent to specifying "*"  (that is, all jobs are considered
          by Anacron).

          Unless Anacron is run with the -d option (specified below), it
          forks to the background when it starts, and any parent processes
          exit immediately.

          Unless Anacron is run with the -s or -n options, it starts jobs
          immediately when their delay is over.  The execution of different
          jobs is completely independent.

          If an executed job generates any output to standard output or to
          standard error, the output is mailed to the user under whom
          Anacron is running (usually root), or to the address specified in
          the MAILTO environment variable in the /etc/anacrontab file, if
          such exists.  If the LOGNAME environment variable is set, it is
          used in the From: field of the mail.

          Any informative messages generated by Anacron are sent to
          syslogd(8) or rsyslogd(8) under with facility set to cron and
          priority set to notice.  Any error messages are sent with the
          priority error.

          "Active" jobs (i.e., jobs that Anacron already decided to run and
          are now waiting for their delay to pass, and jobs that are
          currently being executed by Anacron), are "locked", so that other
          copies of Anacron cannot run them at the same time.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          -f     Forces execution of all jobs, ignoring any timestamps.

          -u     Updates the timestamps of all jobs to the current date,
                 but does not run any.

          -s     Serializes execution of jobs.  Anacron does not start a
                 new job before the previous one finished.

          -n     Runs jobs immediately and ignores the specified delays in
                 the /etc/anacrontab file.  This options implies -s.

          -d     Does not fork Anacron to the background.  In this mode,
                 Anacron will output informational messages to standard
                 error, as well as to syslog.  The output of any job is
                 mailed by Anacron.

          -q     Suppresses any messages to standard error.  Only
                 applicable with -d.

          -t some_anacrontab
                 Uses the specified anacrontab, rather than the
                 /etc/anacrontab default one.

          -T     Anacrontab testing. Tests the /etc/anacrontab
                 configuration file for validity. If there is an error in
                 the file, it is shown on the standard output and Anacron
                 returns the value of 1.  Valid anacrontabs return the
                 value of 0.

          -S spooldir
                 Uses the specified spooldir to store timestamps in.  This
                 option is required for users who wish to run anacron
                 themselves.

          -V     Prints version information, and exits.

          -h     Prints short usage message, and exits.


-------------------------------------------------------

::

          After receiving a SIGUSR1 signal, Anacron waits for any running
          jobs to finish and then exits.  This can be used to stop Anacron
          cleanly.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          Make sure your time-zone is set correctly before Anacron is
          started since the time-zone affects the date.  This is usually
          accomplished by setting the TZ environment variable, or by
          installing a /usr/lib/zoneinfo/localtime file.  See tzset(3) for
          more information.

          Timestamp files are created in the spool directory for each job
          specified in an anacrontab.  These files are never removed
          automatically by Anacron, and should be removed by hand if a job
          is no longer being scheduled.


---------------------------------------------------

::

          /etc/anacrontab
                 Contains specifications of jobs.  See anacrontab(5) for a
                 complete description.

          /var/spool/anacron
                 This directory is used by Anacron for storing timestamp
                 files.

          The Anacron README file.


-------------------------------------------------

::

          Anacron never removes timestamp files.  Remove unused files
          manually.

          Anacron uses up to two file descriptors for each active job.  It
          may run out of descriptors if there are lots of active jobs.  See
          echo $(($(ulimit -n) / 2)) for information how many concurent
          jobs anacron may run.

-----------------------------------------------------

::

          Anacron was originally conceived and implemented by Christian
          Schwarz ⟨schwarz@monet.m.isar.de⟩.

          The current implementation is a complete rewrite by Itai Tzur
          ⟨itzur@actcom.co.il⟩.

          The code base was maintained by Sean 'Shaleh' Perry ⟨shaleh@
          (debian.org|valinux.com)⟩.

          Since 2004, it is maintained by Pascal Hakim ⟨pasc@(debian.org|
          redellipse.net)⟩.

          For Fedora, Anacron is maintained by Marcela Mašláňová
          ⟨mmaslano@redhat.com⟩.
