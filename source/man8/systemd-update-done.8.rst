NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-update-done.service, systemd-update-done - Mark /etc/ and
          /var/ fully updated

          /usr/lib/systemd/systemd-update-done


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-update-done.service is a service that is invoked as part
          of the first boot after the vendor operating system resources in
          /usr/ have been updated. This is useful to implement offline
          updates of /usr/ which might require updates to /etc/ or /var/ on
          the following boot.

          systemd-update-done.service updates the file modification time
          (mtime) of the stamp files /etc/.updated and /var/.updated to the
          modification time of the /usr/ directory, unless the stamp files
          are already newer.

          Services that shall run after offline upgrades of /usr/ should
          order themselves before systemd-update-done.service, and use the
          ConditionNeedsUpdate= (see systemd.unit(5)) condition to make
          sure to run when /etc/ or /var/ are older than /usr/ according to
          the modification times of the files described above. This
          requires that updates to /usr/ are always followed by an update
          of the modification time of /usr/, for example by invoking
          touch(1) on it.

          Note that if the systemd.condition-needs-update= kernel command
          line option is used it overrides the ConditionNeedsUpdate= unit
          condition checks. In that case systemd-update-done.service will
          not reset the condition state until a follow-up reboot where the
          kernel switch is not specified anymore.
