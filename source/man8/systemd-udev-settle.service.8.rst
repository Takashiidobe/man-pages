NAME
-------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-udev-settle.service - Wait for all pending udev events to
          be handled


---------------------------------------------------------

::

          systemd-udev-settle.service


---------------------------------------------------------------

::

          This service calls udevadm settle to wait until all events that
          have been queued by udev(7) have been processed. It is a crude
          way to wait until "all" hardware has been discovered. Services
          may pull in this service and order themselves after it to wait
          for the udev queue to be empty.

          Using this service is not recommended.  There can be no guarantee
          that hardware is fully discovered at any specific time, because
          the kernel does hardware detection asynchronously, and certain
          buses and devices take a very long time to become ready, and also
          additional hardware may be plugged in at any time. Instead,
          services should subscribe to udev events and react to any new
          hardware as it is discovered. Services that, based on
          configuration, expect certain devices to appear, may warn or
          report failure after a timeout. This timeout should be tailored
          to the hardware type. Waiting for systemd-udev-settle.service
          usually slows boot significantly, because it means waiting for
          all unrelated events too.
